            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And beſides, ſeeing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall travells in theſe tempeſtuous times, cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted with any ſafety, here you may in the quiet ſhade of your Studdies travell at home. If therefore a worke that is <hi>Bonum, utile &amp; jucundum,</hi> good, profitable, and pleaſant, may deſerve your favour, <hi>Hic labor, hoc opus eſt,</hi> this is it. So that as <hi>Alexander</hi> grieved that there was but one <hi>World</hi> for him to conquer, ſo you will be ſorry that there was but one <hi>World</hi> for <hi>Mercator</hi> to deſcribe. Enjoy therefore that which is both good in it ſelfe, and was undertaken for your good, and benefit. <hi>Valete.</hi>

            <head>The Preface to the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat many ſollid and urgent reaſons did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, who among the liberall Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines which without controverſie are very profitable to mans life, doe give the firſt place to the noble Art of <hi>Geographie,</hi> they ſhall beſt know and diſcerne, who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider both the excellencie, and pleaſure, as alſo the incredible profit of this Art. For, as concerning the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and excellencie thereof, it doth not intreate of meane matters of ſmall moment, as brute <hi>beaſts,</hi> the <hi>fruits</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> pretious <hi>ſtones, mettalls,</hi> and other workes of nature, the handling whereof no reaſonable man will contemne; but it preſenteth to our ſight the whole Globe of the Earth as it were in a Mirrour or Looking-glaſſe, and doth ſhew the beautie and ornaments of the whole Fabricke of the world, and containeth all things in her ample and ſpacious boſome, and like the vaſte Sea, it doth not onely open and lay forth the hidden and remote Jſlands, but alſo all other Countries. To omit the neere affinitie which this noble Science hath with Aſtronomie, which mounting above the earth doth contemplate the Heavens.</p>
            <p>Moreover, if men as often as they heare ſome relation of this or that Country, of any ſtrange unknowne people, or of any rare and unuſuall Creature, or of the continuall burning of the Mountaine <hi>Aetna,</hi> alſo of divers Jſlands lying here and there in the great Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and alſo of Salvage Nations, ſome whereof goe naked without cloathes, others feede on mans fleſh, and the like matters; or doe reade the wonderfull hiſtories of the Eaſt and Weſt Jndies, (in which there are many things which doe rather ſeeme fabulous than
<pb facs="tcp:23886:5"/>
true) doe apprehend them with ſuch great admiration, and give ſuch earneſt attention thereunto, out of the deſire which they have to heare ſuch novelties; how much more may the curious Readers delight in this worke, which, as we ſaid before, doth containe and repreſent the whole Globe of the Earth, with all the Countries, Kingdomes, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, Woods, Mountaines, Valleys, Rivers, Lakes, People, Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and innumerable Townes thereof, with the Seas flowing about it: all which any one may here view on dry land, without endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his body or goods; and in this travell his friends ſhall not be ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous or take care for him in his abſence, or earneſtly deſire his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. Beſides, in this peregrination or travell he ſhall want no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light that may drive away the tediouſneſſe of the journey; for while he fixeth his eyes on ſeverall Countries and places, he ſhall ſtraight way behold the ſpeciall gifts and peculiar excellencie of every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and obſerve a wonderfull variety therein, which are very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the mind, for as the Proverbe ſaith, A good merry companion is as a Coach upon the way.</p>
            <p>But they ſhall chiefely diſcerne the great and manifold benefits of this Art of Geography, who in their eye-travell, and viewing of ſeverall Countryes, ſhall conſider the ſcituation and diſpoſition of Countries, the Cuſtomes, obſervations, lawes, and manners of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and ſhall afterwards traffique, and ſend commodities to ſeverall places, or reſolve to ſtudy the liberall Arts; ſeeing no Poet, nor Hiſtorian can be well read with profit, nor be conveniently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded or declared by any Interpreter or Commentator, without the helpe and knowledge of this moſt Noble Science. J omit here to mention how abſurd and unfit it is, that he who hath no skill nor knowledge in theſe matters, ſhould give his opinion and judgement in the publicke aſſembly or councell of the Common-wealth, when conſultation is held about the diſcovery of ſome unknowne Country, or in time of warre concerning the bounds and confines of any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.</p>
            <p>But Princes and Noble men ought chiefely to beſtow great paines in ſtuddying this moſt excellent Art, in regard it may be very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto them in undertaking journies and voyages when occaſion requireth, as alſo at home for fortifying the Frontiers of their owne Territories, or the directing and conducting of any warlike expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For that irrecoverable dangers have enſued when an army hath beene led through places unknowne both to to the ſouldiers and
<pb facs="tcp:23886:6"/>
Captaine, both <hi>Livy</hi> and many other Hiſtoriographers have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly teſtified by cleere and manifeſt examples.</p>
            <p>And moreover, as it is very neceſſary, profitable and pleaſant to know all Countries, Kingdomes, Dominions, and Provinces, with their ſcituation, diſpoſition, and qualities; ſo in like manner the ſeverall Seas, Rivers, Lakes, and memorable waters thereof, ought to be conſidered exactly in theſe times, when voyages are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made, unto knowne and unknowne Countries, ſo that not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one will continually reſide at home, and abſtaine from making diſcoveries both by Sea and Land. So that <hi>Polidore Virgils</hi> complaint is now vaine, who in the fifteenth chapter of the third Booke concerning the Invention of Matters, doth condemne mankind of too much raſhneſſe, and madneſſe, in regard he cannot bridle his affections and deſires with reaſon: and though God hath given him the Earth, being a firme and immovable element, abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing all things neceſſary and convenient for mans life, yet he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not content therewith, hath made a Scrutiny and ſearch into the ſtarres, the heavens, and the vaſte Seas. To the ſame purpoſe <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi> ſung formerly, in his firſt Booke, and third <hi>Ode:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>He had a heart of Oake or Braſſe,</l>
               <l>Who did lanch forth a brittle ſhip, to paſſe</l>
               <l>At firſt through the rough Seas,</l>
               <l>And did not feare, when he ſet forth</l>
               <l>The Affrick wind ſtriving with the North</l>

            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>And a little after in the ſame place:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>No ſort of death he ſure did feare</l>
               <l>That ſaw the Monſters ſwimming there,</l>
               <l>And could behold them with drye eyes</l>
               <l>With the ſwelling Sea and rockes which in it lyes.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>And afterward he addeth;</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>In vaine did God divide the land</l>
               <l>from the unſociable Seas,</l>
               <l>If impious ſhips can ſayle unto</l>
               <l>forbidden Ports when they doe pleaſe.</l>
               <l>But mankind bold ſtill to adventure</l>
               <l>doth on forbidden miſchiefe enter &amp;c.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And hereunto <hi>Propertius</hi> in his third Booke doth allude, in that Elegie wherein he bewayleth <hi>Petus</hi> his Shipwracke, where he ſingeth thus:</p>
            <q>
               <pb facs="tcp:23886:6"/>
               <l>Goe crooked ſhippes, of death the fatall cauſe,</l>
               <l>Which on himſelfe man with his owne hand drawes.</l>
               <l>Vnto the earth, wee added have the Seas,</l>
               <l>That the miſeries of misfortunes may increaſe.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>And a little after:</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Nature to enſnare the covetous man,</l>
               <l>Doth let him ſayle upon the Ocean.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But theſe reaſons are not able to diſcourage any one, but rather to quicken their induſtry, greedily to take any occaſion to know, view and diſcover divers Countries both neerehand and remote; partly by undertaking long voyages: and thoſe that cannot conveniently travell, may gather the knowledge of all Countries out of Bookes and exact deſcriptions. And truely that ſtuddy is irreproveable, ſo that it ought rather to be accounted laudible, profitable, pleaſant and neceſſary. For <hi>Strabo</hi> in the firſt Book of his Geography ſaith right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that man ought to live on the Sea as well as on the land, and that God made him equally an Inhabitant and Lord thereof. Therefore they deſerve great praiſe, who have laboured in this Art, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>Concerning the uſe of theſe Tables.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Tolomie</hi> and we in this booke, doe make the Longitude to be a ſegment of the Aequator, or Aequinoctiall Circle, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended with the Meridian of that place, and the Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an of the Fortunate Iſlands: for from theſe Iſlands the beginning of Longitude is taken.</p>
            <p>Some doe not begin the Longitude from the Fortunate Iſlands (which are now called the Canaries) but from the Flandrian Iſlands, which are now called the <hi>Azores,</hi> becauſe the needle of the compaſſe doth point there directly toward the North. But the ſuperficies of the Globe contayneth in Longitude 360 degrees.</p>
            <p>The Latitude is the Arch or Segment of any place betweene the Aequinoctiall and Parralell which is drawne through the verticall point of the ſame place, and it is alwayes to the elevation of the Pole.</p>
            <p>Latitude is twofold, either Northerne, or Southerne, and there are reckoned from the Aequinoctiall to either Pole 90 degrees of Latitude.</p>
            <p>We have noted the degrees of Longitude and Latitude on the ſides of all the Tables, and for the moſt part, the degrees of Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude on the toppe and bottome, and of Longitude on the right and left hand, except when ſome Country is to be deſcribed that is more extended betweene the South and North.</p>
            <p>The ſeverall degrees both of Longitude and Latitude, according to the capacitie of the place, are ſometimes divided into 60, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into 10. 6. or 5. parts, which are called minutes, and we have noted the degrees with greater Arithmeticall figures, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes with leſſer for difference ſake.</p>
            <p>If one would finde out the Longitude and Latitude of any place, where the Meridian Parralells are, by taking with a paire of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes the diſtance thereof from the ſide of the Table, and afterward by applying the compaſſes to the other ſide. If thou takeſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Eaſt ſide, the compaſſes being turned from that ſide to the North ſide, will ſhew the degree and minute of Longitude. If thou haſt the diſtance from the North-ſide, turne thy compaſſes from thence to the Eaſt ſide, and it will ſhew the Latitude. But if the Meridians be not Parralells, the Latitude of a place is found in the ſame manner, but in the Vniverſall Tables where the Parralells are circular, the diſtance of a place being taken from the next ſide, will ſhew the ſame on the Eaſt ſide. But the Longitude is to bee taken with a thred or Ruler, layd upon the place and turned untill it doe point out on the Northerne and Southerne ſide, the ſame minute of the ſame degree, and whereſoever it be, that is the Longitude of the place.</p>

            <head>How to finde out the diſtance of degrees or Miles betweene two Citties, or any other Places.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have added ſcales of Miles to all the Tables, by which thou mayſt eaſily finde out the diſtance of all places in this mannner.</p>
            <p>Take a paire of Compaſſes, and open them untill the <hi>2</hi> feete doe touch the extreame points of the places given, then appy them without any alteration to the ſcale of miles, and the numerall figures noted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will give the diſtance.</p>
            <p>But if the Diſtance of places doth exceede the length of the Scale, then with thy compaſses thou ſhalt take the length of the Scale, and thou ſhalt turne the Compaſſes from one place to another, as farre as the diſtance of places will permit, and then reckon the miles together. But becauſe the length of miles in all Countryes is unknowne, thou ſhalt more certainely take the diſtance of places with thy Compaſſes, and apply the Compaſſes without variation to the degrees of Latitude, which will give the true diſtance, by multiplying them by the Miles of the knowne Country.</p>
            <p>But the Miles doe differ much in divers Countries, and therefore I will here inſert their difference in the chiefe Countryes.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a common Axiom among thoſe, who are in any wiſe elevated in the contemplation of the worke of this frame of the world, that God who is the Author thereof, is of an immenſe power, wiſdome, and goodneſſe, and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that a man ſhould doubt of his power, who belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that created of nothing, and that the matter thereof is not eternall. If there be any man, to whom this power and goodneſſe of God doth not ſufficiently appeare, as not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving yet conſidered well the commendable, exquiſite, and moſt wiſe ornament, and diſpoſition of this Fabricke, let him then diligently enquire with us, ſo farre as the contemplation of the workeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip it ſelfe may perſwade him, and as farre as is lawfull to know by the Word of God, and the experience of things. For this is the maine ſcope we ayme at, that in handling Coſmographie, the infinite wiſdome of God, and his inexhauſt goodneſſe, may be knowne, as well by the admirable concordancy of all things to one and the ſame end of God, as alſo by his inſcrutable providence in the compoſition, whereby wee may bee continually rapt up to reverence and honour his Majeſty, and to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his rich goodneſſe. God grant then, that he will be pleaſed, to enlighten our darke underſtandings with his light, and direct our mindes, to the finding out of this true wiſdome. It is ſo then, that this immenſe goodneſſe of God, not able to containe his owne glory in himſelfe, by reaſon of ſuperabundant fecunditie to beget, was willing to create man, to whom hee communicated the ſame, and having conceived in his wiſedome, to inveſt him a body, ſuch as we ſee, as his firſt Creation ſheweth him to be, Created and brought forth the world by his Almighty power, and digeſted it into that order, nature, and proportion, according to that <hi>Idea,</hi> which he from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity had conceived, furniſhed with all parts neceſſary for the uſe of man, ſo crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Therefore the cheife end of the workes of God, and his primary intention, was to communicate his glory. The ſecond was the creation of man. The third, the diſpoſition of all things in the world, and the laſt drift of his intention, was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the worke. It behoveth him then, that will undertake the deſcription of the world, to beginne at its firſt <hi>exordium,</hi> who would profitably extend it to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie.</p>
                  <p>Curious men were wont to aske, firſt what God did before he Created the world, how and where he was then, when as yet there was neither place, nor time? ſecondly,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23886:13"/>
why he did not Create the world many Ages before? and wherefore he did not make man ſo perfect, that he could not fall? to which frivolous and raſh queſtions, he will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily anſwer who hath knowledge as farre as the Scriptures and the worke of God tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us of the ſacred Trinity, and who ſhall diligently obſerve the true definitions of time, and place: but this impiety, and wickedneſſe of men are not worthy the anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; for it is religion, not to pry further into the hidden ſecrets and judgements of God, then he hath revealed unto us in his holy Word, and to diſpute of things that are out of our element, and before the world was, and of things that are above our reach and capacity, is meere madneſſe and folly: ſeeing they beget onely opinions, not ſciences, and therfore can bring no true wiſedome along with them: but rather produce ſtrange doctrines, which obſcure and darken the truth.

Firſt of all, in that they make the intellect or Spirit Fabricator of the world, out of this one, and diſtinguiſh him entirely from him, and make him another afterwards. Againe, in this, that ſeparating the matter it ſelfe from all forme, they underſtand it not to be the generation of any <hi>Idea:</hi> for <hi>Ideas</hi> are ſpecies or formes, which can engender nothing but formes, and ſo
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23886:13"/>
conſequently muſt of neceſſity follow, that they underſtand it, not to have beene Created, but that it is eternall. The originall of this errour is, becauſe they beleeved the matter was onely ſuſceptible of formes, and that it had no communion with the formes of nature, and therefore have not onely once dreamed, that it was in the ſeedes of formes, and that the force thereof might be conducted by the worker. Whence they were at length conſtrained to conſtitute a certaine perpetuall, and a formall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning out of the matter. By the ſame reaſon, they were induced to ſet downe one ſelfe-ſame out of one, and diverſe from him, ſo cutting too neere the quicke, and ſpoyling this one, and primary beginning of all things out of this one, begotten of one, but diſtinct in Eſſence and propriety of nature, from whom alone as from the Father, firſt, and immediately depended the firſt modell of the worke of the world, and of the immediate vertue <hi>formatrix</hi> of things. The traces of which doctrine <hi>Valentine</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added other fancies unto it, having found out a meane, whereby one, whom he calleth <hi>Proarch</hi> and <hi>Bythum,</hi> hath proceeded to the generation of the Spirit, and by ſome generation comming betwixt afterwards. Finally, deducing it to the Creation, aſwell of the matter, as of all things, and even mixing therewith this prodigious Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> whom his diſciples following, taught the ſame doctrine in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuring and adulterating the truth in all parts; more then with old wives fables, but ſeeing the raving of theſe men, vaniſhed of it ſelfe, we will rather have reſpect to the Theology of the Platoniſts, and to the originall of the world, the which as it hath more appearance of divinity, then all others, and ſeemeth to come neere to the <hi>Moſaicall</hi> truth: ſo likewiſe it may more eaſily draw us to true and ſacred Philoſophy. And therefore in propounding a briefe ſumme thereof, we will oppoſe againſt it a true narration of things drawne as well from the ſecrets of the holy Scripture, as from nature, confirming the one, by ſolid reaſons, and rejecting the other wherein it ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the truth; to the end that under the colour of a more divine Theologie, the eyes of underſtanding be not dazled in the ſearch of this philoſophy, wherein much falſitie is contained. That it may alſo appeare to all men, that among the <hi>Ethnicks,</hi> there was never Schoole ſo holy, no care ſo fervent, no wit ſo excellent, that by their owne induſtrie could attaine unto the truth of things; conſidering alſo the moſt Religious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, even the Platoniſts themſelves wandred aſtray, and miniſtred matter of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to others. Wherfore let us give thankes unto God alone, who is the beginning, the Creatour, the Animatour, the Conſervatour, and the end of the worke of the world: And that it pleaſed him by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his other Prophets to reveale unto us the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke of the vniverſe, the beginning and fountaine of all Philoſophy and of all truth.</p>
                  <p>This then is the Sum of the Platoniſts Theologie, they lay downe three beginnings,<note place="margin">

                        </p>
                     </note> in things divine, to wit, one Spirit and Soule which are called in their fables <hi>Coelus, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnus</hi> and <hi>Iupiter:</hi> following one another in order. The chiefeſt whereof is he, whom they make to be their firſt and Soveraine God. Him they call one, in regard of his moſt ſimple eſſence, and good by reaſon of his ſuperabundant fruitfulneſſe to engender, and facility to communicate himſelf: they deſcribe him to be, neither being, nor eſſence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intellect, nor good, adjectively: neither to underſtand no not himſelfe, neither to live nor to move, but to be above all theſe things, that is, the beginning and originall of being, and eſſence of intellect, and of intelligence, of life, and of motion, and the firſt and ſupreme of all things, that may be apprehended, beſide himſelf. Again, that he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in himſelfe, that he differeth from all things, that he conſiſteth in himſelfe, and cannot be mixed with things ſequent, and yet nevertheleſſe that he is preſent in all things, and that he containeth all things, and in like manner he is every where and yet no where, that is to ſay, he hath no neede of any place, neither is he finite, nor determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, neither within, nor without, but is the power of all things: yea the greateſt power of all powers, and yet is not all things, but above all things.</p>
                  <p>That this one or good, produceth from his owne abundance, not by conſent of any cogitation, not by any counſell, not by any determinate will, not being moved by any meanes, but abiding in his owne habitude, by his owne peculiar perfection, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed by a potentiall act, or an efficacious power, internally hee created a beame, which hee diſpearſeth almoſt like the Sunne, that abiding one and the ſame immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſpreadeth its light, which beame in aſmuch that on a ſudden, it is made that which it is, abiding in him, it becommeth a being, but in that it is converted naturally to the Parent, whence it received its motion, it is made living, from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23886:14"/>
whom being fortified, and repleniſhed with power, and perfection, is enriched by it ſelfe, of the ſame Intelligence, and becommeth a Spirit, and Intellect, and as well in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to his Father, as to himſelfe becomes Intelligent: but in as much as regarding himſelfe, and being well acquainted with his owne power (how farre it is extended, as that from whence the vertue, which is the <hi>Genetrix</hi> of all taketh her force) defineth to himſelfe his eſſence, which hitherto was indefinite, and indeterminate, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it explicate, not in applying thereto his Spirit, or in paſſing it into his underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as a man doth in ſeeking that which he hath not, or deſireth to know, that which he is ignorant of: but by a ſole and perpetuall Act of his underſtanding, which never ſlumbreth. An Internall act, (I ſay) of his eſſence, having evermore an eye to his power, and knowing determinately things, which were hidden, without addition of Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, ſo (I ſay) he conceiveth in his underſtanding the <hi>Ideas,</hi> or formative ſpecies of all things, which they call intelligible gods, and engendreth them in ſome ſort. Diſtinguiſhed by a formall reaſon, but the ſame in eſſence, as many exiſtents One. I ſay not One, and many, but One many, as <hi>Parmenedes</hi> will have it, for the leſſe nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous unity, as well in the thought, as in the ſoule, and as the Intellect is repleniſhed with power received from One: ſo likewiſe being full of <hi>Ideas,</hi> or the formes of all things remaine one and the ſame with them, all beings exiſting in this, and them true, becauſe they are immutable and eternall, which as <hi>Saturne</hi> ſuddenly ſwalloweth them up, as being engendred from him, and in him, ſuffering them to fall into the matter of things naturall and fraile: but keepeth all things in himſelfe, and contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth without diſſolution or partition, and poſſeſſeth all things in one, being preſent alſo to all things, and in all places, and yet nevertheleſſe is not in them, but they in him, as depending of him, and conſiſting in him. Now as the intellect is One many, that is one being of himſelfe all, and in identity of eſſence, or an unity impartible, but diſtinguiſhed in himſelfe, according to the parts, abyding together, and inwardly by an alterity, is not partible in ſequent being, but remayneth alwayes with it ſelfe, as one is not diſtributed into ſequents.

And <hi>Plato</hi> calleth it <hi>Idea,</hi> becauſe it comprehendeth in its eſſence the Patterne and ſole individuall ſpecies of all things.

                  <p>The Platoniſts then aſcribe to Divine things, theſe three beginnings in the ſame manner, as I have declared them. As for the firſt, they doe not agree, that it is an act of ſome One (as it ought not to be) or that it hath any action: yet they grant that it is <hi>potentiall,</hi> that is to ſay, that it hath the power to produce; retayning the ſimplicity of One. But that the Intellect, is is an act flowing from one. And that the Soule alſo is an Act from this ſame intellect, and that both the one, and the other, are differing from him, from whom they proceed. That he alſo who begetteth is greater, and better then he which is begotten of him: and therefore the intellect is leſſe, and worſe then the One; but that it is better, and greater then the Soule, and likewiſe the Soule then the Species, which it produceth. This is the meaning of all the Platonicke-Theologie, againſt which we will heere oppoſe that which is more true.</p>

For in every worke three things are neceſſary in a worker, Power, or beginning of the internall Act, the Conception and the Diſpoſition of the Act, or the Internall worker, and the iſſue of the Act. Even as in fire, the beginning of the heate, is the nature, or forme of the fire, the act of it, is the internall heate. The Action, or act proceeding is the heate, which commeth out of it. And the Soule is the beginning and motive power, it is the diſpoſition, or will to move, it is finally the motion it ſelfe. But becauſe that God hath not created the world, either by chance, or through ignorance, ſearching the meanes how, or wiſedome, but with a great deale of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and wiſedome, it cannot be denied, but that from all eternity, he had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome certaine determinate modell,<note place="margin">The Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the world peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly belong<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth to God the Father.</note> and all the Idea's of his workes, to which we give not beginning in the Word, as <hi>Plato</hi> doth, but to the Parent of the world, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that whatſoever the Sonne hath, he hath it from his Father, and for this cauſe we will place the Father firſt, as the Seminary reaſon of the world, the Sonne, the force vegetative, the Holy Ghoſt, the vertue Productive, and animative, the which with him proceeding from the Father, and being ſhed out by the Sonne, it paſſeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a worke. So, the Holy Ghoſt, which is abounding in the Father, awakeneth this Almighty and inexhauſt fountaine of the Eather, and the immenſe fecundity of the Sonne encites him (as it were) to budde forth, and by the quickning ſpiration of his holy Spirit, the Father begetteth the world, by a meane and ſeminall reaſon, having conceived it, gives it to his Sonne, as he who properly expreſſeth the Father, from the Sonne already by act the world is brought forth, but by the meanes of the Holy Ghoſt as being the Chariot, whereby the world ſpreadeth it ſelfe, through its parts, and is animated in all things according to the proper Idea of every one of them. Now the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit accompanyeth the worke alwayes, and in all things, to the end that that which is conceived by the impregnant activity, and formed by the quickning motion thereof, is alſo conſerved by the ſame: It accompanies not then all things in ſuch ſort, that therefore it is divided into parts, but indiviſibly, and in the ſame manner as the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſts call it, the Soule of the world to be preſent in all things, and is not ſo ſevered from them, that it becomes, either the Soule, or the forme of every one, but abideth in himſelfe, and in all things preſent, and divers, and ſeparated from all, hee formeth all things at once by the Power of the Father, by the Act of the Sonne, every one in his eſſence, and forme, accompliſhing by degrees, both the eſſence, and the matter, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the reaſon of the modell, and afterwards appropriateth all things, according to the law, conceived of the Father.</p>

Herein wee will follow the text of <hi>Moſes,</hi> conſidering it particularly, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, according to the gift of grace which I have received from the Lord. In the beginning (ſaith he) that is, when as yet there was nothing created, and that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſtie, by the counſell, and determinate lawes propoſed to begin the Creation. In the firſt point (I ſay) and moment of their exiſtence of things, which yet were as nothing, but a beginning onely of things, without any forme, or condition of things, or of exiſtence, even (I ſay) in the moment of time, he begun to create: and after God created without any prepared matter, by his immenſe, and incomprehenſible power this huge maſſe, which was without forme, rude, and confuſed, out of which hee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards drew all the parts and members of the world. In this creation of matter, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in that which enſueth, three things were neceſſarie. The fruitfulneſſe of the Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall power, the effectuall and pregnant power of the Word, and the force fructifying, conceiving and quickning of the holy Spirit, for the matter extracted had the beginning of its exiſtence from the power of God, as from a Seminarie reaſon, by the fructifying vertue of the holy Spirit, both formed it, and brought it into being, even as the fruit in the belly, and being at laſt hatched by the power of God, quickning, and nouriſhing, the ſame, is made manifeſt. So the onely God Almightie, conceived, formed, and brought forth into the light, out of nothing in the vigour of his triplicitie, and without the aſſumption of any ſubject, the matter of all things, which were to be created, not by the operation firſt of the Father, afterwards of the Word, and finally of the holy Ghoſt; but all working, and conſpiring jointly together inſeparably, and unceſſantly, among themſelves in the unitie of the divine eſſence. Now this which is ſaid, In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ought to be ſo underſtood, as <hi>Eſdras</hi> doth, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. ſaying: <hi>O Lord thou haſt ſpoken from the beginning of thy creature, ſaying, Let it be made, &amp;c.</hi> Now in that hee ſaith from the beginning of the Creature, he ſheweth ſufficiently, that this beginning or originall, ought not to be underſtood of the Son of God, but of the firſt moment of the Creation, which is alſo manifeſt, as well by the prepoſition, as by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the words, In the beginning, and Creature, for to joyne this verbe; Thou haſt ſpoken, with that of creature, the thing it ſelfe contradicteth it: ſeeing the creature was not yet in being, to which God might ſpeake. Moreover for as much as <hi>Moſes</hi> (as I have ſaid) wrote deliberately againſt the Gentiles, ſetting downe a beginning to the world. This beginning can be no otherwiſe underſtood, then as wee have interpreted it: for if he had ſaid, to have created in his Sonne (which is alſo true) and meaneth thereby no other thing, whence then can we gather an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the Eternity of the world, or of its matter, ſeeing the beginning it ſelfe is eternall. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaketh ſimply of a temporall beginning, and not otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By the heaven and the earth,</hi> he underſtandeth not two diſtinct and different bodies, ſignified at this day by the names of heaven and earth, for then neither heaven nor earth had their beings, according to their proper forme, but that heaven was made the ſecond day, and the earth laſt appeared, the third day; the waters being ſeparated, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the other parts of the world, created of this Primative maſſe were reduced into order. By the heaven and the earth then, he underſtandeth figuratively, this firſt maſſe without forme, wherof the heaven and earth were formed. <hi>Moſes</hi> then had to do with the Gentiles, to whom he teſtifieth, that the heaven and the earth which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold had heretofore beene created of God, as he will ſhew afterward, and uſeth names and things knowne, the better to leade men to the conſideration of their beginning. For <hi>Moſes</hi> meaning was, to pull out of all humane underſtandings, all Rapſodies of Philoſophers, and their falſe doctrine, touching the eternitie of the world, and its mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by this way to ſubmit it to the glory of God, as he ſilently ſheweth in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and fourth Chapter. But, he taketh the heaven and the earth figuratively for the matter of them. Theſe Epithites following demand it, <hi>Thohu</hi> and <hi>Bohu,</hi> which hee attributeth to the ſame maſſe, created firſt of all: becauſe it was without forme, vaſt, void, ſolitary and vacant, &amp; doth not adjoyne thoſe Epithites to the heaven and earth, but to the earth onely, carrying the Reader by this meanes, from the contemplation of perfect bodies, to their primarie matter, and hereby underſtandeth, not the earth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in her forme; but this indigeſted and deformed Chaos, uſing nevertheleſſe the word earth, becauſe it better reſembleth the condition of the earth, when he continueth the deſcription of this maſſe, and calls it <hi>The Hom,</hi> that is to ſay an <hi>Abiſſe.</hi> And ſo by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees conſtraineth the underſtanding of a contemplating man; yet being void of all

determinate kinde of things, for the contemplation of the firſt matter of heaven and earth: nevertheleſſe in this word <hi>Abiſſe,</hi> he painteth out ſome certaine kinde of forme, of this primarie matter, to wit, that it was a liquid and fluid matter, and that bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, as that which in all things, was like and equall unto it ſelfe, as water to water, and clay to clay.

The Chaos being created, firſt it is to be thought upon, how God firſt of all did diſpoſe thereof. Above all things it is neceſſary, firſt of all to aſſigne it a fixed place, for wee ſee that the heavieſt of all bodies is the earth, to which this maſſe hath a better reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance than to the heaven. Now had it not bin in a fixed place, it might eaſily have fallen into an infinite of pieces, the weight alwayes urging the motion. But to the end he may here marke well the beginning of things, let him well obſerve, that God of the moſt baſeſt and groſeſt Element, of the moſt illfavouredſt, and without any forme begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his creation by little and little, mounting up to the higheſt, to the nobleſt, and to the divineſt things. Obſerve likewiſe, he beginneth with the moſt ſolid, and moſt firme bodies, that the things which ought to be prepared appertaining to the life and perfection of creatures, which are all fraile, and changeable, to the end (I ſay) that all theſe things might have a firme ſubject to which they might be faſtened and made firme: he aſſigned them a place for the earth and the Chaos, to wit, a point in the midſt of the void, upon which it reſted, and beyond which it is not permitted to move. This is the greateſt miracle of all nature, ſurpaſſing the capacitie of man, and humane cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: were it not that the wheeling courſe of the ſtarres, and the navigations round about the world, did not manifeſtly witneſſe the ſame for who could beleeve, that ſo ponderous a weight could ſubſiſt hanging in the midſt of the Heaven? and yet the truth thereof makes us beleeve it, who is hee that could underſtand, that ſo huge and ſo heavie a maſſe can ſubſiſt, and without any ſupporter ſettle it ſelfe? What man is he that can imagine that it hath a foundation there where it hath no underpropping? Rightly did God then diſputing with <hi>Iob,</hi> in the midſt of his anguiſh demand of him, if he underſtood where he laid the foundations of the earth, he ſhould declare it, <hi>Iob</hi> 38.4. Here is the inſcrutable wiſedome of God, and his incomparable power, therefore it is not poſſible for a man to give a ſound reaſon touching this goundwork, but onely the will of God, who followeth the cauſes &amp; reaſons which are hidden in himſelf, and whom all things muſt obey. As he willed, ſo it was done, his will miniſters him matter for the framing and forming of all things, his will from one ſole body, from one onely forme, faſhioneth many of divers formes; from that which is without life, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any activity, hee produceth it immediatly into force and vegetative vigour, into life, motion, ſenſe and intelligence, and which is more, all things which he created, are ſo tied, and agree together, by a mutuall love, whereunto all things tend, that hee cauſeth them by the ſole impreſſion of his will, to have a naturall affection, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine inclination to that dutie which is imprinted in them, according to their Creators will, by the harmonious conſent of the <hi>Ideas</hi> in the divine thought: So this Chaos, and above all that which is the heavieſt in it, to wit, the earth deſireth unceſſantly the point which is aſſigned to it in this vacuitie, by an impreſſion from the will of God, and is moved towards him, by a certaine deſire in its ponderoſitie, till that it hath obtained a like reſting place on all parts, ſupporting and ſuſtaining upon it, the other parts of the world, as upon its ſhoulders. This then is the nature of the earth and ſo likewiſe of the Chaos, and the ſympathy which it hath with all other creatures, which he ſubjecteth to all in the ſeate, which hee hath appointed to it, which is the Center of the world, and being ſetled firme round about the Center, reſteth and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up all other things; and ſeeing it beareth up all other things, and ſeeing it is moſt imperfect, it ſeeks help and bleſſing from on high, to produce that which it is enjoyned to do. In this point then the Chaos reſteth neceſſarily, becauſe the Lord hath appointed this for its place of repoſe, &amp; as a bound for the motion of its weight, which bound and limit it cannot nor will not paſſe; becauſe the Lord hath ſpoken, it muſt be ſo: and this nature, this Sympathy is given to it from the Lord, as a neceſſary ſuſtentation of all the Species, and individuals, for which reaſon, <hi>David</hi> ſaith <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.5. <hi>He hath laid the foundation of the Earth upon Baſes, that it ſhould not be mooved for ever.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.6. <hi>O give thankes to him that ſtretcheth a out the Erth above the Waters.</hi> Now becauſe this Chaos is the mother of all Creatures, not only of the inferiour bodies, but alſo of the caeleſtiall, and of all things Created, as we ſhall heare anon, we ought not to doubt but all the Elements, yea, all the Heavens, up to the very higheſt, beare the nature of their mother, ſome more, ſome leſſe, and have ſome weight for to encline downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23886:17"/>
towards the midſt, and exerciſe their Sympathy, as well towards the Earth, as among themſelves, by a certaine cheriſhing, a gentle touching, and as it were by a feeling. Now experience alſo teacheth us that the weightieſt things, by nature draw more eaſily, and neereſt to the Center of the World, and the ſeate (I ſay) of ponderous things: Whence proceedeth a moſt certaine reaſon of order in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, that the things which are lighteſt, and ſubtileſt have the ſuperiour place, and not onely that, but alſo the Shpaericall figure of the Chaos, and of the whole world, take from hence their Sourſe, for ſeeing the nature of the Chaos was floating, and ſo altogether, and that all ſides of equall vertue and facility, was borne by its weight to this reſting place, ſo that all the extremities were equally diſtant from the Center, and ſubſiſted from every part of the Center with a like weight: for if the diſtance hereof had beene unequall from the Center, more weight had laine upon the one ſide of the Center, than upon the other. Suppoſe that in this Cube the Center be <hi>a,</hi> the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, <hi>b c d e</hi> and that thou beholdeſt <hi>b</hi> out of <hi>d,</hi> to the Angle <hi>d</hi>

The Chaos then muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily conſiſt of an equall weight under the Sphaericall figure, and no figure elſe could be ſo convenient for the world, ſince that the ſupreame and moſt perfect bodies, ought to march about the circumference of the Earth, for the helpe of generation by a perpetuall circumvolution. <hi>Iohn de Sacroboſco</hi> &amp; ſome other Mathematicians, approve beſt of the Sphaericall figure of the Earth, by ſome apparent accidents: but it is much more excellent, to demonſtrate every thing from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it ſelfe, and out of the cauſes (I ſay) becauſe the ſollid ſcience proceedeth by this way. It is cleere then, that the point found out of theſe things all ready prooved, ought to be called the Center of the world; becauſe of the weight thereof, and the ſetling place of all ponderous things. Now Phyſitians call it the loweſt of all, and the other the higheſt, in affirming that the motion towards the middle, is made downward, but from the middle upward, and that rightly, becauſe that ought to be called Supreme, which is moſt perfect, and which may conferre upon others ſome more excellent nature, but the loweſt is the fartheſt from off them, as well in place, as in condition,

               <head>CHAP. IV. Of the Fabricke of the World. <hi>Of the nature and forme of the Chaos, or primary matter.</hi>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Oſes</hi> ſheweth moſt clearely; that the light which was Created out of the Chaos in the beginning, was the principle of al things made by God, producing out of the ſame all the workes of the ſixe dayes: now his firſt propoſition argueth evidently, that there was nothing Created by God before this matter, otherwiſe he would not have conſtituted therein the beginning of the Creation. Seeing then, that all things are made after this manner, and out of it, to ſearch as is requiſite the originall of nature, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the beginnings, according to the truth of naturall philoſophy. It is neceſſary above all things to conſider moſt diligently, what this primary matter was. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſophers troubled themſelves much in the conſideration of this matter, they durſt not deny, but that it was, and yet would in no wiſe grant it to be eſſence, they ſaid it was neither quantity, nor quality, and that it had neither of them in it, and ſo made it naked of all quality and forme, when they teſtified it to be as a meere Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And ſome of them proceeded ſo farre in their impudency and temerity, as to ſay, that God laboured to ſubdue this matter, and to make it ſubject to formes. What can be ſaid more fooliſhly, or ſpoken more villanouſly againſt the omnipotency of God? to wit, as if he, who was able to make and to induce formes elſewhere (much more noble then the matter it ſelfe, as they would have it) could not alſo Create a a matter, which he himſelfe might ſubject to all the worke? But ſuch is the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and blindeneſſe of humane underſtanding, that without the guidance of the word of God, it cannot, as it ought, comprehend and know any thing certainely, of that which is ſo farre from ſenſe; and which hath its originall Divine: Likewiſe this is a very great folly, to goe about to meaſure and ſearch out of their ſhallow braines, the moſt deepe myſteries of nature, her primary originall (I ſay) and the extreame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſſe of the counſelles and workes of God. Nature her ſelfe can teach us, that all things were created of a matter, but who dare be ſo bold, as to obtrude for Oracles, the manner and conditions of that matter, which are no where ſhowne, either by Gods word, or any footeſtep of nature, yea which are contrary to the manifeſt Word of God? they ſpoile the firſt matter of all forme, and of all condition, and kinde of being, in ſuch ſort, that it cannot be ſaid, what way it can ſubſiſt in it ſelfe. But <hi>Moſes</hi> calleth it in Expreſſe words, Earth, Water, and the Deepe, before that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create forme, or any new Species was wrought upon it. And in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> 3.20, It is called <hi>Aphar,</hi> that is, clay, whence it appeareth, that the ſame had from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſome kind or forme of Earth and Water, and conſequently greatnes and weight. But ſome one may object, that Philoſophers to diſtinguiſh betweene things conſidered the matter by it ſelfe, and likewiſe the forme by it ſelfe, to teach more evidently the cauſes of things depending on qualities and formes, not on the matter, as alſo the generation or production of the kindes, which is wrought by the acceſſe of the forme to the matter, which is well ſaid; and we alſo our ſelves affirme the qualities, and formes to be active, and begetters of Species, but not the matter voyd of them. But herein they erre grievouſly in two things, firſt of all in this, that aſcending from the laſt and moſt perfect forme to the firſt of all, which can be imagined, they ſeparate them all equally from the matter, and hold them as acceſſors, and induced from elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, ſo that at length they leave the matter naked, whereas according to the true production of Species, deſcribed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> it is not lawfull, to aſcend above the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the Chaos, ſignified by <hi>Moſes,</hi> for this having beene the firſt beginning of things, in this all things are finally reſolved, according to <hi>Eccleſiaſtes. Chap.</hi> 3. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could they amount higher paring that, ſeeing they cannot proove it to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded? Secondly, they faile yet more grievouſly in this, when as they make all formes ſo eſtranged from the matter, that they deny it to have in it any ſeminary ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23886:18"/>
or ſmall note, but will have it to take its primary beginning elſewhere from without the matter, which we impugne, ſeeing it is manifeſt out of the generation of the world, and divine teſtimonies, that the primary matter hath had its owne forme, quality and quantity, and that out of the forme thereof, the formes of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things did proceed. Moreover, it is moſt abſurd, yea, contrary to the nature of God, to Create ſomething without forme, and without all vertue and quality, as well by reaſon of his purpoſe, as by reaſon of his Majeſty; and Omnipotency; of his purpoſe, becauſe ſeeing he hath appointed all things for the ſervice of man, to what purpoſe ſhould an idle mother ſerve, which neither can doe any thing of her ſelfe, nor is able to bend the qualities and vertues received, but rather ſlackens them, for if thou will ſay, ſhe conferreth ſomething to the qualities received, thou affirmeſt at once things contradictory. The matter not to be neither quantity nor quality, nor yet to comprehend either as her owne in her bowels, and yet nevertheleſſe to be endowed with ſome vertue, as ſhe worketh ſomething. Now in reſpect of his omnipotency, and Majeſty it doth in no wiſe beſeeme God, to create a matter wholly voyd of forme, for ſeeing that he is a forme forming all formes, a pure light, a pure vertue and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, a pure life, and a breathing goodneſſe; how can he produce any thing voyd, and dead, who hath directed his maine ſcope unto life? He who conceived to Create man after his owne Image, how ſhould he beginne a ſluggiſh and dead foundation, and forme man of that then of which nothing can be more unlike, yea, more contrary to, and eſtranged from God? He who maketh the beginning of ſuch an excellent, and incomparable worke to be ſo vild, injureth the Almighty, and doth detract from his Majeſty and Omnipotency. <hi>Empedocles,</hi> and <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> ſeeme to have had a better and a righter opinion of the primary matter, whom <hi>Plotinus</hi> reprooveth in his Booke <hi>de Materia, Chap.</hi> 7. For <hi>Empedocles</hi> did not ſo endleſly pare from the matter, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nude it of all qualitie, but when he had learned by experience, that all bodies are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into the Elements, whereof they were compoſed, and did not find any further reſolution, he ceaſeth to ſearch out any higher the beginning of the matter, as being ignorant of the firſt matter, whereof the Elements were produced. Now whereas <hi>Plotin</hi> objecteth againſt him the corruption of the Elements, it hath no place, becauſe the Elements are not corrupted, but onely the mixtures, by whoſe putrifaction and reſolution the Elements are repurged and reſtored to their integrity. But <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> comming neereſt to the nature of the Chaos affirmed a certaine wateriſh mixture to be the primary matter, erring indeed in the mixture, but perhaps becauſe the right name did not occurre he would deſcribe it by a ſimilitude the neereſt to the thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taught by a moſt ancient tradition, that the firſt matter of all was <hi>APHAR</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he added that this ſame matter, had not onely a paſſive fitneſſe to all things, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would have it, that it might receive formes induced from elſewhere, but that it actually (ſupply not expreſly nor potentially) contained in it ſelfe, or in its owne eſſence all formes, and all Species, wherein ſurely he erreth not farre from the truth, as it ſhall appeare in the progreſſe, but if we would have the Species to bee formed from the matter, as <hi>Plotin</hi> ſeemed to ſay, certainely therein he erred: for the moſt imperfect cannot produce the moſt perfect, but it ſelfe hath neede of one to perfect it. Now for to attaine to the true doctrine of the primary matter, omitting the dreames of the Pagans (I ſay) briefely, what I thinke ought firſt to be thought of it, and in the purſuite thereof will proove it out of the Word of God, and the conſent of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible nature with it: ſuch then is the ſtate of this matter.</p>
               <p>The Omnipotent God, Lord of nature, is able onely to Create whatſoever he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, whereof <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt gives teſtimony in the third Chapter of Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewes</hi> Goſpell, and in the third likewiſe of Saint <hi>Luke.</hi> That God is able of thoſe ſtones, to raiſe up Children unto <hi>Abraham, verſe</hi> 9. And who without any ſubjected matter to worke upon, was able out of nothing to Create this viſible world, much more could he then alſo in a moment, make out of all, all whatſoever he would. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe he himſelfe, hath followed in Creating a manner, and rule, which hee gave to nature as we ſhall ſee anon. Now nature being once ordained, and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by God, doth not all what ſhe willeth, out of all that ſhee willeth, but ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth it out of the matter, which is the neereſt to that, which nature propoſeth, for ſuch is infinite providence. So ſhe engendreth not out of a ſtone Corne, but of an
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23886:19"/>
earthly and wateriſh moyſture, neither doth ſhe produce fire out of water, but out of oyle, and yet more out of brimſtone, A quality then accommodated to things, which are engendred, is required in the matter, and we ſee by this univerſall law of nature once conſtituted by God; that nothing is begot is out of nothing, nor out of a matter affected to the contrary, or improper to generation.</p>
               <p>All opperation then of nature, in the matter affected to the contrary and improper, is violent, leſſe nevertheleſſe in the improper, than in the affected to the contrary. Now that, which ſuffereth force, the operatour being taken away, it returneth to its naturall courſe, unleſſe it be vanquiſhed by an act of longer durance, and by little and little is drawne into the nature of the operator. All generation then in the matter is violent, if we ſay, that it was without all quality, and naturall affection, whereby it may be enclined to engender. Now the generation, and continuation of the ſpecies, their multiplication and their agreement, and ſympathy of things among themſelves, is neceſſary as it is ſaid, in the fift Chapter, and as a may ſee manifeſtly, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in the Oeconomie of the world: It was requiſite then that the matter out of which ſomething was to be engendred, ſhould firſt have ſome nature, and condition proper to it ſelfe, which might be meete to the Species intended,; which ought to be engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred out of it.</p>
               <p>This ſame nature if in ſome ſort, it had not had a roote in the primary matter, out of the Creation, how could it be enclined to that duty, whereunto God had appointed all things, to wit, to ſerve for the uſe of man? What ſympathy could there ever be of things among themſelves? which is ſo neceſſary to be knowne and obſerved by us, that the Holy Ghoſt, which ſuſtaineth, and directeth all things created to this uſe (the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking in the eight Chapter to the <hi>Romanes</hi> deſcribeth it amply) when he ſheweth us, the incomparable greatneſſe of the glory, which ſhall be manifeſted to us by the ſervice of theſe Creatures, ſaying. The earneſt expectation of the creature wayteth for the manifeſtation of the Sonnes of God in glory, that is, it doth the duty, which God hath impoſed upon it cheerefully, ſuſtayning carefully mankind in this life, with a deſire that they might be ſaved, and be led to God their Creatour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And ſo this ſervice of the Creature ſaith he is done to many vaine and unprofitable, and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it is not ſubject to this vanity of its owne accord, that is, it is not all one, whether it is ſerviceable to the good, or to the bad, but aſmuch as it is able doth the office which is enjoyned to it, to the glory of God, and the Salvation of man. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, God hath ſubjected it to this vanity, that it might ſerve alſo to the wicked, though in vaine, yet not ſimply, but by reaſon of him, who hath ſubjected the ſame in hope, if peradventure they might in groping, taſte the benignity and benevolence of God, and be converted. And to ſhew, that it ſerveth to the wicked unwillingly; adding that it ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the children of God, after which the whole Creation groaneth, to wit, till Chriſt our Lord, and nature having finiſhed the laſt propagation of mankind, ſhall bring his faithfull ones into the glory of God his Father: thou ſeeſt heere moſt manifeſtly, how great the Sympathy of all things is betweene them and man which were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be done out of a matter without all forme, or void of any quality or affection. But thou wilt ſay out of the Philoſophy of the Pagans, that God hath ſince given a forme unto the matter created, out of which thereafter generation and propagation is made. And to what purpoſe I pray you, hath he made in the ſecond place, and by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond operation, that which he might have done at the firſt, and by the firſt Creation? might he not aſwel from the beginning, have given the matter properly qualified, in its owne nature, as afterward to have given the quality, and that by force? Againe, can he which is al forme, vertue, a moſt perfect, a moſt mighty, and a moſt good Act, the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it ſelf, and the fountaine of good, procreate ſomething altogether without forme, and moſt alienate from all manner of affection and action? Now the Lord would create man his chiefe worke, after his owne Image, for otherwiſe how could hee enjoy the glory of God in diſſimilitude? Things that are unlike, delight not in things unlike, but abhorre them, it is then requiſite for man to have a great ſimilitude with God, as he which ought to participate greately of his glory. But the holy Scripture witneſſeth, that the univerſall glory of God ſhall be manifeſted to his Saints, and that we ſhall be like unto him, becauſe we ſhall ſee him as he is, the greateſt ſimilitude then, betweene
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23886:19"/>
man and God, ſhall be in the life to come, the beginnings of which excellency he hath received in the Creation, as <hi>Moſes</hi> teſtifieth in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> as he who from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his Creation, ſhould converſe with God, and ſerve him in this world in all obedience, untill he were accrued into the ſimilitude, which God concreated with him, and ſhould receive his higheſt perfection in the Heavens.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore that man is Created after the Image of God, and that alſo the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Creatures, for having a true ſympathy with Man, to whom they ought to be ſerviceable; have likewiſe obtained ſome ſimilitude with God in the Creation it ſelfe, eſpecially, the primary matter, to wit, the Chaos out of which all things were created; yea man himſelfe ought to have ſome ſimilitude with his Creatour, for it had beene abſurd (as I have ſaid before) that God the fountaine of all goodneſſe ſhould have created ſome ill thing, and that he, who is all life, and quickning vertue; ſhould create a ſtupid body, voyd of all quality or affection, which ſhould be immediately reformed, to the end it might agree, aſwell with the Species, which were to be created, as with man. For ſeeing the worke of every Artiſan, ſheweth the induſtry, wiſedome, and the ſtudy of his Spirit, how much more then the workes of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent as well his intention, as in ſome ſort his Image. He then, who from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning hath thus formed and ordained nature, that ſhee might bring forth a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, no otherwiſe then from a matter properly qualified, hath alſo created and produced the firſt Species of things, out of a Chaos convenient thereunto.</p>
               <p>We conclude then, that the Chaos was the firſt of all things, having in its eſſence, the ſeede of all qualities and formes, a nature (I ſay) ſimple, and not compounded, deducible and diſtributive into ſo many qualities and ſpecies, as there is now in univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall nature. Alſo that it was like to its Creatour in this, that as God the Father is the beginning of all Deity, having all things covertly in himſelfe, which are expreſſed actually in the<note n="*" place="margin">The Father worketh of himſelfe by the Son and the holy Ghoſt, the Word his Sonne from the Father by the holy Ghoſt, and the holy Ghoſt from the Father and the Son.</note> Word, his Sonne, and ſhed abroad by the Holy Ghoſt, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with the Creatures, that ſo alſo the Chaos comprehended all the formes of things, ſubſtances and qualities, ſecretly within her bowels, and intrinſicke eſſence, according to the Seminary and Radicall power, which being by the Creator extracted out of it, perfected and diſtributed into ſeverall Species, ſerved man by an act of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient. And as in God the Father, the multitude of Idea's, not as many, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed under one ſimple unity, is brought forth from God by the Creation into every Species, ſo the Chaos being a nature ſimple, and not compoſed, is produced, and made perfect by the Creation in ſo many ſubſtances and kindes, as is requiſite for the body, and Oeconomie of the world. And like as the ſubſtance of God is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, neither conſiſting of matter or forme, but an indiviſible eſſence, yea in thought, ſo alſo the ſubſtance of the primary matter, or Chaos, is not compounded, nor conſiſting of matter and forme, introduced from elſewhere, or a new Created in it, but in a ſimple eſſence, Created from one act by a ſimple being God and a vitall ſubſtance and life, or a ſubſtantiall forme, or eſſentiall ſubſtance, or in any ſuch ſort, that the vnity of the matter and forme may be expreſſed exiſting: in this nevertheleſſe, before other differences the moſt diſtant from God, that it is corporeall, and groſſe, actually finite in vertue and power, being onely a ſmall beginning of theſe things, and diviſible into different ſubſtances, yea even to contraries, not immediately, but by the degrees of generation, which are betwixt both. The ancient Philoſophers have not given a ſound diviſion of the Primary matter, in having made two beginnings of things diverſe, and not communicating, to wit, the matter, and forme. In things which are engendred, ſuch a diſtinction brings with it ſome light to the underſtanding, when as we contemplate the matter out of which ſomething is made, and the forme which it ought to be, introduced: and which as yet doth not exiſt in the ſeverall parts, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as the cauſe of the thing requireth, but when as we make this in the firſt matter, and out of the cauſe of generation, we conceive a matter wholly without forme and voyd, and we wander aſtray from the true naturall beginnings.</p>
               <p>The Chaos is then in things which are created out of God, eſſence of eſſences, forme of formes, ſubſtance of ſubſtances, not by act, but by power, and that not forraigne, but interiour, making the matter and the beginning of the forme, as a mother to all things. But firſt of all, God is the Worker, then the vertue ſpecificall: ordained by God, in forming them, perfecting and preparing for the birth. Wee ſhall ſee then

this opinion of the primary matter, and of the Chaos to be confirmed by the Creation of the World, and the certaine experience of things.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>VT foraſmuch as through the ſiniſter underſtanding and conſiderations of Idea's and formes, many abſurd things are taught by the Philoſophers, queſtions, and intricate diſputes are moved, and the true order of the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in nature is obſcured, it behooveth us to ſearch out more deepely the condition and nature of the Idea's and fermes, that not relying upon a falſe foundation, we doe not deceive our ſelves, and inſtead of true ſcience, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſo many vaine opinions as fooliſh dotages. When the Philoſophers would that the formes ſhould be brought elſewhere into the matter, they aſſigne unto them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other beginning, and ſeparated from the matter, to wit, a certaine eternall Idea, out of which they flow, and are joyned to the matter, ſo that every eſſence is not ſimple, but one compounded of divers things, and ſeparated, and incommunicable of matter and forme, and therefore the matter and forme had not any ſimilitude in the eſſence, nor any Sympathy betweene them, before the compoſition. It is well knowne and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall, that every good workeman, before he beginne his worke, conceiveth a certaine Idea thereof, by the contemplation of which, he beginneth and accompliſheth it, but are many things oftentimes, which preſent themſelves ever and beſide the modell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, he addeth or taketh from it, and if diverſe men ſhall undertake the ſame worke in Species, there will be as many differences, as workemaſters. There is not then any Idea out of man, which conceiveth and frameth ſuch a modell in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but he himſelfe by the cleareneſſe of his underſtanding, and according to the knowledge which he hath of things, which are required, be it true, be it falſe, and according to the judgement of his reaſon, he imagineth and frameth the accident by experience, or elſewhere he amendeth it, after upon better knowledge. So God as by himſelfe, being the moſt wiſe, moſt mighty, and the moſt skillfull Architect of the world, hath created all things no otherwiſe, than by a moſt good and exquiſite rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It is neceſſary therefore, that he of himſelfe from all eternity had conceived an Idea moſt requiſite for his worke; for it is not the property of a wiſe man, to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing without good order, manner and reaſon, for the things which are ſo made, are either made caſually or raſhly, and cannot promiſe a certaine good iſſue. But he tooke not this Idea, for the framing of his worke, out of a fore knowledge of things with a foreknowne rationation, and meditation as from a certaine modell after the manner of men, ſeeing he of himſelfe, and without any motion of underſtanding, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, inſpection, and auſcultation, is all wiſe, Almighty, having in the vertue of his eſſence repreſented before his view, and pondered all the beginnings of things, the meanes, ends, manners, conditions, number, proportions, habitudes, and all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould appeare viſible, a workemaſter (I ſay) ſo perfect from the moſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Center, and fountaine of his eſſence, hath this increated Idea, ſhining forth in all things, and poſſeſſed it eternally; and this Idea is one, and ſimple, as the eſſence of God is one and ſimple, but proceeding by fruitfulneſſe, as from the generation and propagation into branches and all formes and Species, according to the intention and ſcope of the Creation in the alone ſpecies of man. Therefore whenſoever thou art deſirous, to contemplate inwardly, the creation of things, and art willing to ſearch out well their affinity and Sympathy, it is requiſite for thee to contemplate the ſame, with all the ſubtilty, and force of thy underſtanding, by what order every thing is created, and whereof, and in what manner the one ſpecies exceedeth the other, for from thence the Creatures are knowne, and the order of ſubjection of every one of them, as farre, as may concerne man. It is now in no wiſe lawfull to place this Idea
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23886:20"/>
out of the ſubſtance and eſſence of God, for it is moſt properly proper to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and communicable to no other but to God onely, as his eſſence agreeth to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then to God: nevertheleſſe we deſire with ſome, to make fooles of our ſelves, who have dreamed that all things have beene ingendred out of the eſſence of God, and are as parcels of him, and for this cauſe that the Soules of all returne againe unto him. Seeing therefore that this Idea, is inſeparable from the eſſence of God, it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any man to thinke of any primary beginning of formes and ſpecies but in God. Now if any one ſhould place the Idea's out of God, they ſhould not be the primary, but ſecundary Idea's, created of the primary which is in God, the which when they are placed by the Philoſophers out of things, and are ſaid to enter into the matter, and to conſtitute things themſelves, and the ſpecies compounded, what is that elſe, but to adde a helpe to the Creatour, which formeth all things, ſufficient for all things? as if he himſelfe had not beene able to doe that immediately, or at leaſt, that he vouchſafed not, who is enflamed with ſuch a great love to his worke, and that hee delighteth to be with the Sonnes of men. And if we grant him, who is all vertue, and a pregnant efficacy, and Almighty for moſt noble effects, to have created a matter without forme, idle and wholly imperfect, and of no quality of it ſelfe, why ſhould we ſay it is created of formes, more worthy and noble than the matter, by ſtrange and miniſtred Idea's? were not that to diminiſh the glory of the Creatour? or wilt thou that the matter be created by ſecondary Idea's? What Idea I pray can be fained from that which is nothing, and bereft of all eſſence? For (they forſooth) would have the Ideas to be effectives of formes. Now if any man ſhould affirme theſe Idea's to be made, not onely in reſpect of the firſt Creatour of things, but for the perpetuall propagation of the Species, what difference then would there be, betweene the propagation, and the primary conſtitution of the thing? The Species, ſhould it not be wholy compounded, the forme being induced into the matter? So then, God hath created the firſt man, and the ſame worke of the Creation is conſequently renewed in every man; how is it ſaid, that the Lord reſted the ſeaventh day, and afterwards to create? <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 2. As thoſe who have beene caſt out of the aſſembly of the faithfull, for Heretickes, who did affirme that the Angels were worldly Creatures, no leſſe ſhould ſuch bee, who affirme the Idea's are placed out of God, to conſtitute the Species of things. For ſuch Idea's are alſo Creatures, no leſſe than the Angels: to this may bee added that which I have ſaid before, that if thou doſt conſtitute the Species, and the matter ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and incommunicating (as it is neceſſary when thou makeſt the matter to bee wholly without forme, and that the ſame joyned with the forme, yeeldeth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound not ſimple) it cannot be, that there is any inclination of the matter to the forme or appetite, or any Sympathy whatſoever, riſing out of the different ſimilitude. Many frivilous queſtions, and altogether, unprofitable, are ſprunge out of theſe Idea's ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from God, and from things, the which in what manner ſoever thou reſolveſt them, yet ſhalt thou never attaine unto the truth of the Creation, and Generation, and therefore canſt not affirme any thing certaine, neither of the beginning of nature, nor of the end and Sympathy.</p>
               <p>We ſay then, that there is an univerſall Idea, reſiding eſſentially in God, which is the totall reaſon of all the things, which God was willing to Create, diſpoſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated, according to his infinite wiſedome and will, and that this Idea is expreſſed by an eternall act, eſpecially in the framing of the world, and that the ſpecies are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied and increaſed, into many individuals, without any Idea, co-operating out of God; in this act of every ſpecies, there is imprinted the character of the Idea of this ſpecies, exiſting in God, out of which impreſſion, it is afterward enclined to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of its ſpecies. We call alſo this Idea, or reaſon of all things, to wit, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall act from the eſſence of God, to have proportion to the ſame eſſence: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Creatures which are Images of the ſame Idea, are ſaid to have ſome Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie to the Subſtance and eſſence of God. From whence the moſt high myſteries of the Trinity, ſhine a looſe off as through a grate, and the Catholike Doctrines may be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated excellently, againſt all the hereſies of Trinity, and may in ſome manner be made more cleare, theſe obſcurities being diſſipated: and if any one having invocated the Holy Ghoſt, ſearch with all his might and a pious zeale, the Analogie of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Creatour. But ſeeing the particular reaſons are excited in this univerſall
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23886:21"/>
Idea, by the ligament of a mutuall dependency, and perpetuall harmony, in a moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant melody: it is neceſſary alſo that the reaſons creaturall aſſemble together after ſome manner in a Symphonie by a ſimilitude, but not proportion, becauſe there is no proportion betweene that which is finite, and that which is infinite. Out of this Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phony alſo of the Creatures, or the conſent and concordance of nature and office, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth a Sympathy, the which is neceſſary, becauſe of the end of the Creation. The things which hitherto have beene ſpoken of, partly in generall, and alſo partly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated touching the matter and forme of the ſpecies, miniſtry, and Sympathy, ſhine forth more cleerely, and ſhall be proved in the hiſtory of the Creation.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen as the Lord beganne to Create the Starres, and their motion was not yet in being, and conſequently, as yet there was no time, according to the Philoſophers definition; nevertheleſſe in this darkeſome ſpace, which proceeded or went before the light, is accounted for a part of this day, and is called night and evening: <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.5. and conſtituted with the light following, unto its ſetting, a naturall day, equall to them that followed. This eternall ſpace then is meaſured by God, by the firſt, and laſt, according to the greatneſſe of the parts, and there is no difference, with the time of the Phyſitians, ſaving that it cannot be meaſured, but by the compariſon of meaſure, borrowed out of the Creation; for this eternity going before the world, had neither as yet yeares, moneths, or dayes, or any ſuch like accident whereby it might be meaſured. And if the time of the Phyſitians cannot be meaſured, ſhall it therefore ceaſe to be time? for the meaſuring of a time is an accident belonging to time, it cannot be defined. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is knowne to be, hath its definition in the nature of it, though it cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by words. So eternity is truely knowne to be, becauſe common underſtanding ſheweth it: conſidering, there is not any man confeſſeth that to be, which never was, and that which is, ſometimes not to be, and therefore that which is, there is no doubt, but that ſometime, or in ſome time it was, and this is a common opinion, that that which was in no time, and which is no part, that that is not at al. For it is impoſſible to conceive the eſſence of any thing, without the circumſtance of time and place. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the ſhunning of ambitious and captious tearmes, and many vaine imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, drawne from the definition of time and place, although at this day in uſe, and whereby deceiveable Sophiſters obſcure the underſtanding, as it were with a thicke miſt, it is better to apply the ſpirit to the ſubſtances themſelves of time and place, or if thou wilt may rather be called eſſence, and if ye cannot expreſſe their reaſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe expreſſe words are wanting, nevertheleſſe to contemplate them, after ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſimile. So thou maiſt imagine time to be a certaine extention of durance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the firſt, and the laſt, which after the Creation of the World, is exquiſitely meaſured, by the conſtant and immoveable motions of the ſtarres, and though there were no ſuch meaſurings before the Creation of the World, yet it ceaſed not to have time in it, and if any ſpeculation requireth the meaſuring, we will apply by this our thought the meaſures of this our time, touching the extenſion to the eternall parts thereof. As we would in ſome ſort declare the eternity of God, we may ſay it was a thouſand Ages (I ſpeake of ſo great an extenſion) before the Creation of the World, and beſides them, a thouſand more alſo, and a thouſand beſides, and ſo foreward with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous end. And ſo a common underſtanding may in ſome ſort meaſure the parts of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and what neede have we here of any ſubtile Tergiverſations, and Labyrinths?
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23886:21"/>
Things which are eternall and uncreated, are eaſily conceived by ſome ſuch like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, when they are not defined or well deſcribed. And the Word of God aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth often to him, eternall and infinite ages, from the firſt, to the laſt, accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to the common capacity, which he likewiſe hath formed. Wee may alſo ſuppoſe the place to be a certaine ſpace, wherein the thing is, which we will divide into three ſpecies, into that which exceedeth the comprehenſion, into the equall, and into the leſſer, not determining of any thing touching the greatneſſe of the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion. According to the firſt, man is in a houſe; for the ſecond, every body is in the water, or aire, comprehending on all ſides the extremities: according to the third, every thing, and God principally is alſo in the very leaſt place: the Creature accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> but God according to his whole eſſence. If any one, theſe things being thus determined, ſhould doubt that ſomething was ordained eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally beſides God, he muſt conſider, that time and place are brought in God, yea from his eſſence, conſidering that eſſence cannot be without time and place. For God (as <hi>Iohn Damaſcene</hi> ſpeaketh excellently. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.) is place of himſelfe. In the like manner, and by the ſame reaſon may one imagine, that he is alſo time him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

               <p>Let us ſay then with <hi>Moſes</hi> verſe the fifth, that the beginning of the Creation, and firſt naturall day, was made by night, and that the night is the firſt part of the day, and that we ought to beginne the time of the world, from the firſt motion of the Creation, and that God therefore hath not onely ordained a weeke of dayes, as a memoriall of the Creation, but hee would alſo have us, that wee ſhould take like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the beginning of every day, from the ſetting of the Sunne, and from the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that thoſe judge amiſſe, who would have that the ancient Hebrewes did beginne the day, from the riſing of the Sunne, perſwading them thereunto by ſome paſſages of the holy Scripture, miſunderſtood and perverted in <hi>Exodus, chap.</hi> 12.18. The ſolemnity of the paſſeover is commanded to be celebrated for ſeaven dayes, the beginning, and the end whereof is appointed in the evening. And the Lord ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the firſt and the laſt day ſolemne <hi>ver.</hi> 16. So that the firſt of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 31, it is called the High Sabbath, and the Hebrewes call <hi>Paraſceve,</hi> that is, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, the fourteenth day of the moneth, in which the Lambe was ſacrificed, betweene two Evenings, and diſtinguiſhed from the Paſſeover immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as appeareth. <hi>Matthew</hi> 27.62. <hi>Marke</hi> 15.42. <hi>Luke</hi> 23.54. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.31. Theſe are then, two dayes, and two evenings following one another. The firſt is the end of the fourth day, the other after Sunne ſetting, of the night following, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth to the day following. Betweene theſe two evenings, he commandeth in the ſixth verſe, that the Lambe ſhould be prepared and ſlaine, but that could not be done in a moment, dividing the one, and the other day; therefore the evening is taken more largely, for the veſpertine time, and enclining to the end of the day, or next ending the day, and following incontinently. So <hi>ver.</hi> the eighteenth, when he commandeth them to eate the unleavened bread, upon the fourteenth day from the evening, he meaneth from the evening ending immediately, the day being ſhut up. For ſeeing that the ſetting of the Sunne, diſtinguiſheth the dayes, as the night in which the paſchall Lambe was eaten, and the part of the day before the Sunne-ſetting, in which they ſlew the Lambe, may be referred to a day? In <hi>Marke</hi> the ſixteenth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth more cleerely, that the night was the beginning of the naturall day. When the Sabbath day was paſt (ſaith hee) the women brought ſweete oyntments, which was not lawfull for them to doe upon the Sabboth, they did this then on the evening, the Sabbath being ended, becauſe he addeth, that very early in the morning, the firſt day of the weeke, they came unto the Sepulchre.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt thing which God created, was this Chaos, whereof hitherto we have diſcourſed, to wit, this huge undigeſted maſſe, the matter and mother of all things that were to be created, which hee calleth Earth, becauſe it approacheth neareſt to the nature and condition ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall, for the earth was firſt finiſhed, and brought forth her fruits, and incontinently after, the Chaos being not yet divided, he calleth it waters, not becauſe that then the waters were ſeparated from the earth, but he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that as ſoone as the water was created, the diſtinction of the Elements was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, and therefore before he nameth it Water, hee nameth it Abiſſe, as ſome meane thing betweene a maſſe without forme, and the firſt diſtinction beginning to appeare, or rather he gives us to underſtand, the nature of this maſſe, that it was <hi>Aphar,</hi> a flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting matter, inclining to the generation of Waters, which he purpoſed firſt to ſeparate from the Earth. Now all this maſſe, how great ſoever it was, was an Abiſſe, becauſe that yet it was uniforme, not formed into any ſpecies. The living creatures were not yet, the plants, the bright heaven, yea the Elements themſelves, the Earth, the Fire, Water, and Aire (but there was ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) ſolitude, vacuitie, or ſolitary unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and void, according as we doe call the Earth uninhabited, barren, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing nothing for the uſe of man, Deſert. So, this maſſe was a pure ſolitude, having nevertheleſſe in it the ſpeices, from whence all things which are now might be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and formed, which ſpeices is ſpecially underſtood, under the farme of <hi>Aphar,</hi> of clay, and Abiſſe.</p>
               <p>He addeth that this Chaos had not yet, that which was neceſſarie for the conſtitution of nature, generative and procreative of all things, to wit, the life. Two things ought principally to be obſerved in the creation: Firſt of it all, that it proceede, by the order of things moſt imperfect, and moſt ignoble, to the moſt perfect and moſt noble, as firſt of all from the Chaos, to the Earth, then to the water, from thence to the heavens, and ſo conſequently. Secondly, that it inſtitute the nature of all things, their power, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, order, the manner of doing, the beginnings and the end, and the periods of either of them, and the univerſall law of nature, ſuch in the creation, which hee would have to be perpetually. Willing then, that the inferior world, to wit, the Earth, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Ayre, was the mother of all things, which ought to be engendred, and that the ſuperiour, was the father endowed with maſculine vertue, that is willing to ordain a ſeminarie reaſon in the Elements, but the prepatartixe, and excitratix to engender power in the heavens, preſently after that hee be began to extract the Elements, he extracted withall the matter of the heavens, to the end, that the father, and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might grow up together, that the power, and all the vertue of the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, might receive engendring, his lawes and rules in the ſame creation. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from the beginning of the diſtribution of the Chaos, hee ordained two orders of creatures, and proceedeth by little and little in the one and in the other, to the moſt perfect, and moſt noble, and then when hee began to diſtinguiſh the maſſe into Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he produceth with the Aire, a Celeſtiall and lucent matter, of which afterward the Firmament and the Starres were to be formed and collected, and as in perfecting his worke, he divided to every one his ſpeices apart: ſo alſo hee gave to all of them the proper lawes of nature, to the Elements Elementary, and to the Coeleſtiall, matter Coeleſtiall. It is to be underſtood nevertheleſſe, that as well the Elements, of the Aire, as the heaven it ſelfe, wherein the Stars are, have beene noted afterward in the ſacred Scriptures, under one and the ſame name, as for that then which concerneth the name, which was ordained to them by God, theſe two were in the beginning of the one,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23886:22"/>
and the ſame condition, and were created together, without diſtinction, but preſently began to be ſeparated, to wit, when it was requiſite to forme the Firmament, and the Starres of the nobleſt part of it.</p>
               <p>Obſerve now, what the matter of the Coeleſtiall ſubſtance was. The Element of Water, began now to appeare, and be gathered together in the arch of the Chaos, ere there was there light, which was neceſſary to the operations of nature. And behold (ſaith he) the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the Waters, he ſtirred up a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wind out of the Chaos, to move the Waters, not yet ſeparated from the Earth, and to make them mount up into higher waves, that by this agitation, the Water might begin by little and little to ſeparate it ſelfe from the moſt groſſe ſubſtance of the Earth, and the moſt ſubtileſt being ſtirred out of this wateriſh part of the Chaos, was made Aire, and the more part of the Aeth eriall Aire, or Coeleſtiall ſubſtances. This blaſt made of theſe three things, the firſt day, which without all doubt, made the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to endure longer, and it became more forcible, and vehement, a greater abon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of this windie ſpirit being ſtirred up, till ſuch time, that at laſt, the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſuſtaine it ſelfe, and to gather it ſelfe more together, it allayed by little and little this agitation, and this windie agitation being ſomewhat exhauſt and conſumed, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, by degrees to reſt. When then thou beholdeſt the heaven to be extracted, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of Water, not yet ſeparated, thou maiſt eaſily from thence underſtand, that it hath ſome affinitie with the Earth, much more with the Water, from whence the Hebrewes call it <hi>Shamaim,</hi> from the word <hi>ESH,</hi> which ſignifieth Waters, becauſe it is made of waters, and carrieth the Starres about it, as enflamed waters, according to that which <hi>Egibine</hi> writeth, touching the Etymologie of the nowne. But ſeeing that the Chaos had heavineſſe, as well as greatneſſe, and whatſoever hath beene made thereof, reſembleth in ſomewiſe the nature of a mother, the heavier, and the more ignoble, ſetled together in one, but the lighter and more noble ſubſtance, which as it were the fatneſſe of all the Chaos, being carried upward, was a long time coupled with the ſuperiour, whence it came to paſſe that the heaven was created of the more noble part of the one, and of the other Elements, before they were ſeparated every one into his place, hence it is the heavens excell in beautie, nobleneſſe, and vertue; all the other Elements, as having beene created of the more noble ſubſtance of the Chaos, yea likewiſe in the heaven, the higher things are more excellent than the inferiour: Moreover, the Coeleſtials have a perpetuall ſimpathy, affinity, with the Elements, by which they are mutually enclined, the one to the other, likewiſe alſo the higher things of the Heaven to the lower of them, in ſuch ſort, that there is nothing in the world, which by the ſimpathie given to it, ſerveth not in ſome ſtead, and order for the uſe of man; ſo the Heavens and the Starres, by reaſon of the inclination, which they have to inferiour things, their forme being round, and reſting upon the center of the univerſe, make their motion circular and divers, that they might communicate their vertues to inferiour things, as much as is neceſſary for generation. Now this Heaven was yet in the firſt day, of one and the ſame nature and condition with the other things, and without any difference, and therefore had onely one ſole motion, which diſtinguiſhed the day and the night.</p>
               <p>But as the workmanſhip of the creation continued, the moſt lucent matter of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven began to be gathered apart, into divers Spheres, and Globes of Starres, and Planets, and as every thing began to grow to perfection, and to have its owne proper nature and motion, ſo alſo every one of them, obtained their owne ſympathie, and operation. So the light, or moſt reſplendent matter, ordained for the Sun, began immediately to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſelfe, into the demy part of heaven, and to enter within the Globe of the Sunne; ſo that about tenne houres after the creation (for it began to come into the ſigne <hi>Leo,</hi> as hath beene demonſtrated probably in the Chronologie) it gave light to the world, and foureteene houres after, by the daily motion of the heavens it ſet. This light in the beginning, was alſo more feeble, and weake, becauſe the matter of the Sunne was as yet diſperſed, untill that in the fourth day it was ſhut up and gathered togethered into its greatneſſe. This ſpeculation of the gathering together of the Starres into the Globes, and encreaſing of the light cannot be in vaine, conſidering it was needefull, that there ſhould be light the firſt day, which made the day, ſeeing the Sunne was not perfected, till the fourth day: conſidering alſo that God had not ordained any other light to make
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23886:23"/>
the day, but the Sunnë; likewiſe we muſt not thinke, that the Firmament of heaven, the col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ection of the Waters, into the matter, the drineſſe of the Earth, the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hearbs, fruites, and trees, and all things which God commanded to ſole nature, having beene made in a moment, as the commandement ſeemeth to impart, but by degrees and in the ſame order and manner which hee afterward willed that nature ſhould uſe, and therefore, that all, and every worke began then to be, when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proper to its nature, was prepared, but principally, on that day in which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement was given. So then, the ſeparation of the waters, began the firſt day, and was finiſhed on the third. For if all things had beene created in a moment, God ſhould have ſeemed rather to have intended to produce things, then to ordaine the lawes and natures of them. The contrarie whereof we ſhall ſee in the third day. It being ſo then, that every thing ought to be made, with its proper nature, and naturall law, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately when every thing began to be created, the efficatious vertue thereof began with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, the meane and rule of working, whereby it ought to ſerve God in his creation; ſo that all things in their beginning have had in their creation, as their fore-exerciſes, and by nature once ordained, have ſerved their Creator in the diſpoſition of others. So having made the weight in the Chaos, and the Center and ſeate of all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſetled, the diſpoſition and order of things have followed naturally: So the maſſe being moved by the winde, made naturally the ſeparation of the Earth, and of the Water, and the exhalations aſcended upward. The things which were formed of a Coeleſtiall condition by their Creatour, have alſo exerciſed a Coeleſtiall operation in the generation of hearbes, trees, and living creatures: ſo the creation went forward, the naturall operation followed it, and theſe two afterwards concurred in the other workes of God. Seeing then that this is the order of things, wiſely ordained, and brought to the ſcope of the whole intention of the Creatour; the lover of true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie, may diligently obſerve the order, whereby all things have beene created, what nature of matter, the Creatour gave firſt of all to them, and what he added to their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how farre the ſpeices is extended in forming the things: Moreover to know if the things environing this creation, did give any helpe thereunto, this is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiced, for by how much the more we conſider things that are more high, ſo much the more we ſhall attaine unto the knowledge of the things created, the efficacie and the communion thereof with other creatures, and conſequently its ſympathie, and all its operation. Now to the end that the matter of every thing, may be knowne, wee muſt begin with the firſt matter which is the Chaos, for as much thereof as may be knowne, according to the forme and qualitie thereof, ſo much the better alſo may be knowne the things which are firſt created of it, and as of them ſo of all others. As for the reſt, what matters are added by the Creatour for the eſtabliſhing of the ſpeices, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, this primary nature created cannot teach it, but it muſt be ſought out by the latter, as by the apparent greatneſſe of the thing, the weight, lightneſſe, firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, rarietie, fleeting figure qualitie, colours, office, and ſuch like accidents, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties. The cauſes efficient whereof nevertheleſſe, are knowne by long ſtudy and experience. I give chiefely of theſe things, becauſe they are the firſt foundations (whereunto a Philoſopher ought above all to bend his ſtudies,) to finde out the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Oeconomy of things. Let every man doe as he pleaſeth, but for our part, wee will follow the parts of the world, its ſeate, its proportion, and locall motion, and other things appertaining to Geography, the reſt we will leave to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation of ſpirits more divine: When <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, God ſaid, he doth not ſhew a ſentence given for ſome peculiar time, but the perpetuall will of him which ſpeaketh and effecteth the things without words or expreſſe ſpeech, and produceth them in time definite. So alſo in the actions of God, when he ſaith, God divided the light from the darkeneſſe, hee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not an externall action, but the perpetuall will of God, whereby alone he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and perfecteth all things preordained in time. Now I will not ſay that in this day; this diviſion was compleate, after which the fourth day, the Sun and all the Stars were finally perfected, but he giveth the wiſe not obſcurely to underſtand this colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of light, whereof I have ſpoken, and that the ſame proceeded thus farre this day, that the light gathered together in one part of the heaven, might have power to ſet, leaving behind it the night, and darkeneſſe. After the workes of this day ended, hee addeth this light to have beene approved, and teſtified by God for good, which he did
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23886:23"/>
not of all Creatures, but of theſe onely, which above all others bringeth to man an excellent benefit, and illuſtrateth, and recommendeth excellently, the worke, and the intention of God. So in things following he extolleth with the ſame praiſe the dryneſſe of the Earth, the generations of Hearbes, Trees, and Fruites, the offices of the Sunne, Moone, and the Starres, the wateriſh living Creatures, after alſo the terreſtrials. All which thinges, man being finally created, he approoved them to be very good, as thoſe which were moſt convenient for his ſervice, for whoſe ſake they were created. The workes of the Lord are great, ſought out of all them that have pleaſure therein. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111. <hi>verſe</hi> 2. Light being then brought into the world, the firſt day was accompliſhed, which he ſaith conſiſteth of the evening, and of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or of the night and of the day, he calleth it naturall from the Latines. Hee placeth the night before, becauſe that from it the Creation began, for the light could not be created the firſt of all things, according to the Idea of all things conceived in the underſtanding of the Workemaſter, but the matter was requiſite before, out of which it ought to be formed.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the couching of the light, followed the ſecond day, wherein the firmament was Created. But he addeth not out of what matter, God would it ſhould be made: but this is manifeſt by the Creation of the light. For ſeeing the light was produced out of the waters, ſuch as we have ſaid, and all light commeth from the firmament, it is certaine that that lucent ſubſtance which brought forth the day, and obtained the circular motion, was made this day into the firmament. Whence the firmament in the holy tongue is called <hi>Shamaim,</hi> becauſe it is of the ſame ſubſtance with the light; to wit, wateriſh, though a little more ignoble. For the light, as being the more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, required alſo the more noble part of the ſame ſubſtance, wherefore the ſpecies, and nature thereof, was alſo later perfected; to wit, the fourth day. This firmament <hi>Moſes</hi> calleth <hi>RAKIA,</hi> by which word diffuſion, extenſion, expanſion, and diſtenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are ſignified. The reaſon therefore of this name is taken out of the worke of the Creation, which was made in this order, and ſucceſſe. By and by ſo ſoone as the wind fell to blow upon the deepe, it exhaled upward, and the ayrie and celeſtiall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was diffuſed, wherein whatſoever was proper to light (digeſted into a lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous eſſence) ſtraight begunne to be gathered together, to make up the day: as alſo the ſubſtance of the future firmament, wherein the light was gathered together, and permanent, elevated on high from the element of the ayre; diffuſed, extended, and diſplayed, as a ſaile or tent about the whole inferiour world, and having diurnall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even from the firſt day, and carrying about with it the light. This firmament therefore by reaſon of this diffuſion, extenſion, and expanſion, is properly called <hi>Rakia,</hi> not for the ſollidity, or compact force of the ſubſtance, which <hi>Rakia</hi> doth not ſignifie. Neither doth the matter, whereof this firmament is made, nor that expanſion which here <hi>Moſes</hi> attributeth to it; and alſo <hi>Iſay.</hi> 42.5. and 40.22. Alſo <hi>Pſalme</hi> 104.22. carry with it neceſſarily ſuch a ſolidity, and ſuch a force of ſubſtance; nor is to be ſuppoſed to carry with it; unleſſe ſome argument thereof in the word of God did cleerely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. The compariſon taken from a ſaile ſpread and extended with the winds, and a tent firmely ſet up and diſplayed; doth rather declare the ſtability, immobility, and incorruptibility of it: ſuch a firmament would God ſignifie, and have to be, that it might be a perpetuall ayde, and upholder, of fraile and corruptible things. And what profit, I pray you, ſhould be there of the rigidity and force of yron, or hardneſſe of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23886:24"/>
the Adamant, where there is no wearing nothing that can corrupt. God alſo called this firmament, Heaven, or <hi>Shamaim,</hi> that we might underſtand it to be of the ſame ſubſtance with the light, and together with it to have beene Created. Heere is to bee obſerved that <hi>Eſdras lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. repeating the Creation of the world, ſaith of this firmament; And on the ſeaventh day (ſaith hee) thou createdſt the ſpirit of the firmament, and commandedſt it &amp;c. The order of the Creation teacheth, the proportion of ponderous and heavie things teacheth, the rarity of ſubſtance and experience teacheth that by how much higher from the Center of the world bodies are diſtant, they are more rarified, lighter and more ſpirituall: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it neceſſarily followeth that thoſe things that reſide higheſt of all, are moſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. Now this firmament is much higher than the elements, wherefore it is alſo much more ſpirituall than the ayre, and moſt of all in the extreame ſublimity of it, where ſo many ſtarres have a perpetuall, moſt conſtant, and leſſe variable motion. Now it was neceſſary ſuch a Heaven to be made, after that the maſculine force, which ſubſiſteth in the ſpirituall ſubſtance, was to be inſerted into it: to helpe the imperfect power of engendring of theſe inferiour things. Neither did it ſuffice, the ſubſtance thereof to be ſuch equally throughout the whole, that is to ſay, homogeneall, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variety and nature of things, a variable and turgent fecundity was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo required, which ſhould extend it ſelfe abroad by a naturall inclination to ripen the fruites, of the inferiour world; and as it were to doe the office of a midwife in hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them to bring forth. But that fecundity lyeth in the exundant ſpirituall eſſence, and fortitude thereof, wherefore there neede to be made a collection of this ſpirituall ſubſtance, which is in every heaven or part thereof, into one body ſphericall, as a member genitall. So in the Heaven of the Sunne, the cheife force of the Spirituall ſubſtance is collected into the Globe of the Sunne: <hi>Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> adjoyned to it for the helpe of generation. So the Moone and the Starres, from the firſt beginning of the created light, according to the exigence of their office, were collected, every one into their ſeverall Globes: and the fourth day finally perfected. Alſo the heate and ſplendour of the light, or rather irradiation was neceſſary to the act of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſpirituall vertue, production and intention: wherefore when God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the light, he made light alſo the ſpirituall ſubſtance of heaven. Now if it were poſſible for any one to know the naturall cauſe, and originall of light in ſubſtance, he ſhould attaine unto a great miſtery to enquire after, and in ſome ſort to finde out, the nature of the Starres, which without doubt follow their efficient and materiall cauſe, for if thou doeſt apply all the ſubtilty of thy minde, thou ſhalt ſee the creation of things almoſt follow the naturall order of cauſes, and from cauſes to deduce cauſes, untill it come to the effect propoſed. And this is the incomprehenſible wiſedome of God, that of one firſt created, he did ſo forme and inſtitute nature, according to the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Idea, that he may be thought no leſſe to have imitated, than Created or ordained it. For creating by his will and power the univerſall Idea of nature, moſt exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, he doth alſo moſt exactly imitate and expreſſe, that both in the Idea and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke, the ſame naturall ſucceſſe of things, and of cauſes ſhould appeare.</p>
               <p>Oh the moſt wiſe, and moſt powerfull wiſedome of God, above all admirable! How great ought the affinity of nature be unto its Creatour! <hi>He ſpake the word, and it was made,</hi> his will is the eſſence of it, wherefore as he willeth, ſo is it, and he willeth it for the ſame. God willed, and willed with delectation and ſtudy, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and every Starre in it, by a variable motion, ſhould ſerve man, and for man every Creature.</p>
               <p>This will, this ſtudy, even with a certaine delectation, remaineth imprinted in the Heaven: the Heaven willeth the ſame, is enclined to the ſame, and executeth it dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, with a certaine delectation: the affection of God therefore toward his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is made the affection of one creature towards another. This is the firſt and cheife cauſe, and the originall of all Sympathy, whereby every thing is excited to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of their duty. It is not needefull that we ſhould attribute to the Heaven any other cauſe, or the Angels to be moovers, as though it were of it ſelfe immoveable, and diſperſed his beames idely and without any affection and Sympathy to inferiour things, whereſoever it hapneth, and much leſſe that we ſhould ſay, that it is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually mooved of a divine Spirit, but by a perpetuall nature, according to his will once
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23886:24"/>
imprinted in it, yet in the meane time if thou wilt perfect this Philoſophy concerning Sympathy, thou muſt enquire what ſimilitude, what Analogie with the Creatures, and with which of them, he hath given to the Heaven, whereby it is enclined unto them: as alſo from whence, by what order, and after what manner that ſimilitude and Analogy was inducted into it.</p>
               <p>But when thou haſt aſcended upon this theater, thou wilt cry out, Oh the profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of the riches, wiſedome, and Knowledge of God; how incomprehenſible are his Iudgements, and his wayes paſt finding out! which if thou findeſt nothing, yet it ſhall be a great gaine unto thee, to have learned this imperſcrutability; to the end thou maiſt learne more highly to admire the infinite wiſedome of God, and with a more ready minde to reverence his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>This alſo ſhalt thou eaſily gaine, that thou ſhalt find, there is nothing created of God without cauſe, and juſt reaſon, tending to one ſcope or end. And now I hope thou underſtandeſt what <hi>Eſdras</hi> meaneth, when he ſaith, Thou haſt created the Spirit of the Firmament, and commanded it: to wit, that the coeleſtiall matter, which is moſt ſpirituall, perceiving the Word of God, or the impreſſion of his will, doth with him put on the ſame affection towards man: to wit, that for his cauſe waxing hot, is extenuated, is made ſpirituall, doth elevate it ſelfe on high, above the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ayre, extend it ſelfe, and there remaine fixed; dividing the waters from the waters. Therefore, the celeſtiall matter, having from the will of God and his impreſſion, obtayned this Sympathy, as yet mixed with the Aire, and turned into a more ſpirituall eſſence, by its owne inclination mounted upward; and this is that which he ſaith. The ſecond day was created the Spirit of the firmament, though as yet there was no contraction of the Starres, and Planets, into Globes. It executed alſo the reſt of the Commandement, to wit, the diviſion out of the ſame Sympathy, and inclination the ſame day; and remayneth in the ſame office, untill the will of God (from the which the Sympathy thereof hath dependance) be accompliſhed, as witneſſeth that of <hi>David Pſal.</hi> 148. He hath eſtabliſhed them (the celeſtiall things) to endure perpetually and for ever, he hath given them a ſtatute, and they ſhall not paſſe it.</p>
               <p>This Firmament was not any particular heaven divided from others, but one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine of the heavens, as is manifeſt: for that the fourth day he ſet the Sunne, Moone, and Starres in this Firmament, comprehending all the Heavens which appeare unto us. But becauſe theſe bodies which God hath ſet in the Firmament (and according to the teſtimony of <hi>David,</hi> eſtabliſhed with certaine lawes) are found to have divers motions. It appeareth that this heaven is divided into moe heavens, but how many they are we ſhall probably diſcourſe in the Aſtronomicks. But the manner of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion appeareth in the precedent, when as perpetually the ſuperour things (as more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated, dilated and lighter) have aſcended from the inferiour, as the Water from the Earth, the Aire from the Water, the Firmament from the Aire. So without doubt in the common ſubſtance of the Firmament, by little and little ſuch an extenuation being made, diſcretion and ſubduction on high: firſt, in the loweſt place was the ſphere of the Moone left, and reſted. Secondly, the ſphere of the Sunne, with <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Mars,</hi> then <hi>Iupiter;</hi> and there after the reſt: in manner that the laſt ſeparation of the ſuperceleſtiall waters, the ſame remaineth and is the higheſt part of the machine of the world. The univerſall and perpetuall nature of things, as is the law of things, heavie and light ordained of God, requireth the Oeconomy of the diſtribution of the heavens. For ſeeing that all things are created and formed of the firſt, and one ſelf matter, and therefore do reſemble the naturall diſpoſition thereof, the ſuperiors would be no otherwiſe affected among themſelves, than the inferiors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves: except we will ſay, that when hee came to forme the Heavens, he did make againe the firſt matter, and gave it another much differing eſſence, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and law, but this what were it, but to extenuate the wiſedome and power of God, as though he had not made the firſt matter fit for the Creation of all things. This being granted, what communion of natures could there be, between the coeleſtiall and elementary things? What ſympathy? Were not this to diſturbe all order of things, and to overthrow Gods ſcope and intent in his creation? When therefore the univerſall law of nature doth ſo comport it ſelfe through all things, communicating among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23886:25"/>
it can be no doubt to any, but that thoſe things which proceede from one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable in it ſelfe, and not diſcordant obtaine the ſame reaſon unto that one, as the Sonne to his Parent, and every thing engendred, to his progenitor expreſſe in ſome ſort the nature thereof, and be enclined unto him, as to his beginning bound with the bond of love: Therefore there will be the ſame reaſon of coeleſtiall things among themſelves, as of Elementaries, ſeeing that all things were created ſucceſſively of the ſame maſſe, conformable and concordant in it ſelfe, and the ſuperiours out of their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe and perfection, will embrace theſe inferiours, as their beginnings ſo much the more ſtrongly, by how much they doe more communicate in nature and ſerve man to their utmoſt power. The ſuperiours alſo being more purified, more diſtilled, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct, having a more noble forme ſuperadded, will be alſo the more noble inſtruments of God, unto his ſcope, and end, and will more ſtrongly performe their office there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Wherefore in my opinion, that which the Aſtrologians perſwade themſelves of the malice of <hi>Saturne,</hi> and of <hi>Mars,</hi> is moſt abſurd, as we ſhall diſcourſe more at large in the Aſtrologicks.</p>
               <p>The Firmament being created and ſet in his place, was made (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) from the evening and the morning, the ſecond day, to wit, beginning from the evening as the firſt, and ending againe at the ſetting, and couching of the light: The reaſon of the day is the ſame as before, the which ſerving all the time of the Creation, it ſignifieth, that we ought perpetually to retaine the remembrance of the creation. But hee called this Firmament, Heaven; in Hebrew, <hi>SHAMAIM:</hi> if he called it by a vocall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, he ſo called it for <hi>Adam:</hi> otherwiſe that which I have ſaid, for God to ſay, to be: this is the very ſame as to call; to wit his eternall Will whereby he willed the Firmament to be out of the Waters and made it.</p>

                  </gap>48, and 4. <hi>Eſdras</hi> 6.41. Of them the opinions of writers are divers. <hi>Iacobus Zeiglerus</hi> imagineth very fooliſhly, that the firſt matter of God was created infinite, leaſt there ſhould be thought any thing to be left without the world void: and that in Creating the world out of that matter, he did not exhauſt the infinity thereof, but onely aſſumed ſo much as ſufficed for the Creation, and left the reſt as it was, which he calleth the celeſtiall waters, void, and darkeneſſe, which he affirmeth to be excluded from the World, by the Firmament: which opinion is too abſurd.</p>
               <p>For how can it be admitted that the infinite wiſdome of God ſhould create any thing in vaine? For that is done altogether in vaine which is left voyd without the world, and of no forme or uſe. Which if thou wilt ſay was done to fill up that <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum;</hi> I will demand, whether there was any <hi>vacuum</hi> there from Eternity, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo this was not created? It would bring an inextricable Labyrinth of queſtions, nor any meaſure, order, and law, in the deduction of the parts of the World, out of the Chaos ſhould appeare, but all things ſhould be done without reaſon, and without naturall conſequence: for there ſhould be no place of extenuating the matter, dilating, and ennobling it. Others, and truely not a few, thinke the Superceleſtiall waters, to be the Clouds, which are carryed in the middle region of the Ayre, and that they are ſeparated by the inferiour aire, which is alſo compriſed under the name of Heaven from the Sea and from the Rivers. But hereunto is contrary the holy Teſtimony of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which giveth the diviſion to that Firmament, wherein the Sunne, Moone, and Starres are placed. For the Aire which is under the Clouds, and ſubject to great mutabilities, cannot be called the Firmament: which if they will call the Firmament, becauſe of the perpetuall and immutable ſcituation of it in its place, then ſhould the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23886:25"/>
water alſo be the Firmament, but another firmeneſſe is required. Such a Firmament was requiſite (as I have ſaid) which ſhould ſubſiſt immutable in ſubſtance and vertue for ever, to ſuſtaine the generation and multiplication of things, according to their Species: but this was made after the light, and therefore after the Aire, for the light could not be without the Aire, which ought to environ the Maſſe, and to cary the light, and to make the Day and the Night. Wherefore ſeeing that this Firmament, and perfected one day after it, without doubt it is another different from this inferiour, and more perfect than it, above the which alſo <hi>David</hi> placeth theſe waters. Obſerve (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. his order in praiſing of God. Firſt, in generall he citeth celeſtiall things to praiſe him: then ſummoneth all in a juſt order, and diſtinctly. Firſt, thoſe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite the Heavens, to wit, the Angels and the Spirits of the bleſſed, then the parts of the Heavens: the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, that is to ſay, the Firmament. Thirdly the Heavens, of heavens, to wit, the Heavens which are the Firmament, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it within themſelves: or the Heaven of Heavens, as it is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113. Laſt of all hee mooveth the waters which be above the Heavens.</p>
               <p>Thou ſeeſt how he proceedeth in order from the baſeſt, and loweſt, to the ſupremeſt and higheſt: adding alſo a ſingular and ſpeciall cauſe wherefore they ought cheifely to praiſe God: to wit, becauſe God hath eſtabliſhed them to endure for ever, and hath given them a law and office which they cannot paſſe unaccompliſhed. After the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall things, he paſſeth to the terreſtiall, wherein he comprehendeth the winds, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, haile, clouds, foules of the Heaven: to wit, all elementary things, thou ſeeſt then two orders of praiſers: the celeſtriall and the elementary. Seeing then he pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Super-celeſtiall waters, among things celeſtiall, and immutable, we may in no wiſe beleeve them to be the Clouds. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.3. God is ſaid to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguate, to touch one another, to lay the beames of his high chambers (that is to ſay, of the world) among the waters: which can be no other but theſe waters which are above the heavens.</p>
               <p>Now whereof theſe waters are created, and to what end, it doth not appeare out of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For ſeeing they are not viſible, cannot be perceived with the eye, and do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prelent any thing which might be taken of Gentiles, as matter of Idolatry, and further ſeieng they are the moſt hidden things, and the higheſt of the univerſe Creature, which cannot be ſearched out by any man, it imported not much to explicate their originall and end, or ſcope, wherefore alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> concealeth them, and the holy Spirit doth not openly reveale them. Yet doth he not make mention of them in vaine, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth to godly minds, matter of conceiving ſomething higher, and intimateth the wiſedome of God highly to be admired, and his inexplicable power, where the moſt ſharpe of the underſtanding is dulled, and is not able to proſecute any further, the wayes and profound depth of them. But the originall and matter of them, from hence may be comprehended, in that he nameth them waters, for he ſheweth that they are conformable and co-naturall, of the ſame nature with the Firmament. As alſo <hi>David</hi> when (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.) he attributeth, together with <hi>Moſes,</hi> the higheſt place in all the univerſe unto them. For ſeeing all things which hitherto, (after the waters mooved, and light created) were made, by order of extenuation, and of perfection, were carired up on high, and fixed in their place, it may not be doubted, but by the ſame continued order, it was come to the extreame (as I may ſo ſay) diſtillation, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation, in thoſe ſuperceleſtiall waters. Then theſe waters are the moſt cleare, and pure heaven of all; which the divines rightly call <hi>empyreum,</hi> for ſeeing there is ſo great light in the Firmament, and collected out of the ſame ſubſtance of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which repreſenteth to the eyes and ſenſe, pure fire, the ſubſtance alſo of this laſt, and moſt purified heaven, muſt be a fire much more noble and reſplendant, of an equall cleareneſſe throughout: as in the which there is made no contraction of the light into Globes, which appeareth to be ſo made, for that God would terminate the Oeconomie of whole nature, with the connexity of the Firmament, and therefore writeth that diviſion of waters to be committed to the Firmament; to the end that we ſhould underſtand, that the workes of nature are there terminated, and doe not extend higher than the ſupreame extremity thereof: to wit, the convexity of the firſt moveable; but that they are wholly contained within it, and that without that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity, all things are quiet and immoveable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:23886:26"/>Now for what end this Superceleſtiall water, and this moſt cleare Heaven was created. I will ſay which to me ſeemeth probable. That the Angels were created there is no man that doubteth, ſeeing there is nothing eternall except God onely, all the reſt are Creatures, and have a beginning. But when theſe Angels were created, it is not eaſy to ſay. That they were not created before the world, it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and prooved, for that it is ſaid, in the beginning God Created the Heaven and the Earth, that is to ſay, that Maſſe without forme, the mother of heaven and Earth. Now if the Creation did beginne from that Maſſe, then could not the Angels be firſt created. Yet when the lucent, and bright Starres were placed in the Firmament, from that time they tooke their being: for ſo doth the Lord ſpeake to <hi>Iob chap.</hi> 38. <hi>v.</hi> 6. Who laid the corner ſtone thereof (to wit, of the Earth) when the morning Starres ſang together; and all the Sonnes of God ſhouted for joy.</p>
               <p>The Sonnes of God could be no other than the Angels, for man as then was not Created: Now if the Angels ſang praiſes to God the Creatour, then when he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the Earth upon the corner ſtone, and together with them, the bright ſhining Starres gave praiſe: therefore the third day the Angels were, and alſo the Starres were, although as yet imperfect. For the firſt day in the morning they beganne to be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the fourth day were perfected, therefore they were much more then halfe perfected, and begunne to ſhine, the light being extended, and to praiſe and glorifie God in his ſervice and obedience. But that place in <hi>Iob</hi> 38.6. hath relation to the third day of the Creation, thou mayeſt eaſily underſtand, if thou compareſt the two precedent verſes. For in the firſt, he ſpeaketh of the firſt Foundation of the Earth, that is, when God gave it a place of reſt, the Center of the univerſe: which is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>baſis</hi> of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Of this foundation ſpeaketh <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 104.5. Saying, thou haſt eſtabliſhed the Earth upon her Baſes, that it ſhould not be mooved for ever. In the other he ſpeaketh of the figure which the Earth hath obtained by its weight, on every ſide equally affecting the Center; to wit, Sphericall. But in the ſixt verſe, firſt, he maketh a moſt profound queſtion, to wit, how that Center which is the baſis of heavy things, ſhould be fixed: ſeeing it hangeth of the fluent, and moveable Ayre? Immediately after he ſpeaketh of the ſuperſtruction which is accuſtomed to be elevated on high, and preſſeth chiefely unto the Angles, or corners of the edifices. Who (ſaith he) hath laid the corner ſtone, which ſuſtaineth the Maſſe, aſcending up on high? Thou ſeeſt three parts of the earth brought in queſtion, to be ſetled and eſtabliſhed, in that order wherein they mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſucceeded one another in the Creation, For firſt the Chaos being created, the Earth began to ſettle into the Center. Secondly, in the ſetling received a Sphericall figure. Thirdly, the Earth at length becommeth dry, ſhewed it ſelfe above the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and was there eſtabliſhed, yea, the moſt high Mountaines thereafter hanging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the waters. Of which eſtabliſhment <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh thus (<hi>Pſal,</hi> 24.2.) For he hath founded it upon the Seas, and eſtabliſhed it upon the Floods. The ſixt verſe demandeth in the ſecond part, who hath raiſed theſe moſt high hilly tops, ſo great a diſtance above the waters, and ſo eſtabliſhed them, that they fall not, and returne not to their owne naturall place? Seeing therefore the firmeneſſe and ſtability of theſe was made the third day, when the Earth was made dry, ſolid, and firme, it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether manifeſt, that the Angels were created before this ſcicity, and firmitude was accompliſhed: to wit, the ſecond day. And with this agreeth moſt elegantly, the Creation of the Super-celeſtiall waters, made the ſecond day: out of which it is very likely the Angels were created. For there was no ſubſtance in the whole Creature more fit hereunto, then that cleare and ardent Aire, in the which the Creatour plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that they ſhould have their ſeate, and habitation. Neither was there any other element more convenient for their bodies, than from whence they ſhould take their ſpirit. And <hi>Paul. Heb.</hi> 1. teſtifieth that the Angels are Spirits, and a flame of fire, that is to ſay cleare ſpirits, like the moſt cleare flame, as is almoſt the ſubſtance in the Empyreall Heaven: So that the Angels ſeeme to be created of the ſuperceleſtiall waters; as the Starres: but animated rationall, and mooving themſelves up on high, and downe below for the ſervice of God: whereupon they are called Angels of light, that is to ſay, light ſhining Angels, created out of the light, and dwelling in heavenly light, and doe appeare unto men with great cleareneſſe of light: as to the Shepheards.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE third Day God ſaid, <hi>Let the waters which are under the Heaven be gathered together into one place, and that which is dry appeare. Moſes</hi> minded not to ſay, that finally the third day he ſaid this, and began to ſeparate: but that his eternall will was that this third day, the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the earth and water ſhould be perfected, and the earth be dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and ſhould appeare more high above the waters, having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the waters within her boſomes, to be the ſeate and habitation to all future living creatures, and a ſtorehouſe to afford all ſuſtenance: What things ſoever are in God are eternall: his will of dividing, as well as of creating was from eternity; and alſo of accompliſhing the diviſion, this day was eternall: and it was finiſhed he willed it to be made from eternity, and approoved of it eternally. His ſentence ſtandeth faſt, whereof he cannot repent, it cannot be redargued, reprooved, amended, nor better conceived, becauſe his wiſedome and prudence is infinite, and doth admit no change of counſell and will. Therefore ſeeing this day the diviſion was compleate: God ſaid, (ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) that is to ſay, from all eternity, that the diviſion ſhould be made, and that which is dry appeare, that is to ſay, that the diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould be made untill that which is made ſhould appeare. And when did the dry appeare? even now the third day of the Creation: for he addeth and it was ſo, to wit, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven now incontinent after the ſecond day, which a little before he ſaid was compleate, and before the end of the third day, which he will conclude after in the third verſe.</p>
               <p>Now if any one would comprehend together, the diviſion begunne, and perfected in one day, what conſtitution there was of the order, and law of nature, in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when as now we ſee it to worke ſucceſſively, and by cauſes, and conſequent meanes? It will then neceſſarily follow, that God hath created all things without any order, and law of nature, and that after he ordayned and gave theſe things to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: which were very abſurd, and impious to thinke: for things ought to bring with them their nature, and law of working from the Creation, unleſſe we ſhould thinke that God in creating wanted either counſell, or was not of power ſufficient. When therefore in the ſecond verſe he mooved the waters with a ſtrong blaſt; wee underſtand that he inſtituted the naturall cauſe, in the workes following, and that from the time the Earth was begunne to be ſeparated from the water: but that the third day this ſeparation was perfected, and compleate.</p>
               <p>This naturall cauſe of ſeparation being obſerved, the cauſe alſo of the inequality of the Earth, and of the Gulphes of the Sea may be knowne. For this by this violence of the winde, this <hi>Aphar</hi> created in the beginning, it ſo came from diverſe parts, that it ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated very high, and from hence cellected the low ſetled earth up aloft, but thereupon made deepe, and great valleyes. Thou wilt thinke then that in that part in the which is now the Atlanticke Sea, a moſt vehement wind to have fallen upon <hi>Aphar,</hi> and in like maner in that part where now Aſia, and new India are divided: &amp; that the ſame winds have made in the ſame place vaſt concavities of the low ſetled Earth, and have heaped and raiſed it up on high into the firme lands: alſo that from hence are raiſed divers boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous winds, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> have cauſed the leſſer concavities, &amp; the waters being on both ſides carried on high, have congeſted the earth into mountaines, ſo by the calliſſion, reper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion or beating of the waters one againſt another, thou maiſt underſtand, that the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23886:27"/>
earth was ſeparated from the Waters, and collected through the middle region into moſt high mountaines. So through Africa the hill <hi>Atlas,</hi> and the hils of the Moone. By Aſia, the Mountaine Imaus, and the Caſpian Mountaines, and other Mountaines every where produced. Now the waters after a long agitation being purified from all earth, and collected into thoſe places, reſided where the Lord ſet unto them abound: as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. <hi>ver.</hi> 9. to wit when as all heavie things approach as neare as ever they can to the center of the world, and the water which is fluent, and gliding not able to conſiſt accumulated as the Earth can; it doth alwayes glide downeward to the neather place, untill it come to the very bottome, the plummet, or lead, from whence it cannot aſcend againe, unleſſe a more heavie thing poſſeſſe the bottome. Thereof it commeth, that all waters not being oppoſed, or ſtopped by higher barres, doe runne into the ſea.</p>
               <p>Now here it is to be thought, the Sunne, the Moone, and the other Starres, to be ſo farre forth collected and compacted together, that in the nature which is given them, they begin to have more vehement forces. For now they encreaſed unto the third day, in cleareneſſe of light, and naturall vertue, wherefore it is certaine that it helped much in drying up of the earth. The Wind alſo in ſome ſort as yet blowing through the aire, drew out of myre and dirt, humors perfectly excocted, and extenuated by the Sunne: that for two cauſes the earth might be dried up, and grow into a greater ſolidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie without the which it had remained fluxative, and (relapſed to the deepe places) had, according to its nature, ſetled under the Waters: to wit, as being more heavie; and therefore forcing them upwards. But wee muſt underſtand this ſiccitie of the earth, not to be abſolute, but in mediocritie: ſo great as ſufficed for the eſtabliſhment of the earth, and creation of Plants. For the hearbes were created before it ever rained, which have neede of moiſture, and man was formed of clay the ſixth day. But withall conſider this, if the earth had beene altogether dry, it could not have beene raiſed into high mountaines, and remaine firme. For there is a certaine moiſture which bindeth the earth, whereof comming to be deprived, yet glideth away as the ſand; neither had it beene fit for the engendring of thoſe things, which God would produce in the bowells thereof. Here is alſo to be obſerved, how great the wiſedome of the Creator was in making hollow theſe bayes, and channels, as receptacles of the Waters; for ſo hath he diſtributed the ſea throughout the whole world, that all the kingdomes of the world may have commerce one with another, and what things ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver either nature or art affordeth, may tranſport whether they will. And (which is moſt of all) that the Earth, with the Waters collected together, making one ſphere, might remaine in one equall ballance: for otherwiſe the Earth ſhould not be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon the Waters, but the more heavie weight being collected into one part, ſhould preſſe downe all the maſſe of the Earth, towards the center of gravitie, and of the world, and that depreſſion of the Earth, having elevated more high, and aloft, the Waters lying on the other part, would have cauſed them to overflow, and poſſeſſe the next adjoyning Ilands. For after that the Earth in the ſame quantitie is heavier than the Waters, it is neceſſary that the body of the Earth conſiſt by it ſelfe in an equall ballance: And alſo that the Seas environing the orbe of the Earth, and communicating together, ſhould be ſo diſtributed, that on every ſide lying in an equall ballance, they ſhould not bring more weight into one halfe of the ſphere, in what circle ſoever you compaſſe it, than in another thereunto oppoſite.</p>
               <p>If the Seas did not communicate together, but ſome remained ſhut up within their owne bayes and chanels, the Earth could in ſome ſort (although not throughout, and in it ſelfe) conſiſt equally ballanced. For what weight wanted in one halfe thereof the Waters would ſupply ſhut up in it. But ſeeing the uſe and office of the Seas, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a communion of them among themſelves, for the neceſſary circuit of Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the ſame alſo the exoncration and disburthening of Rivers requireth, which by the onely communication of the Seas equally, and according to an equall ballance, may be diſtributed into all the parts of the Sphere; it was firſt and chiefely neceſſary (as I have ſaid) that the Earth ſhould remaine in an equall ballance, neither could that be ſupplied by the Waters: for they ſhould be raiſed, and heaped up higher, in the lighter, then in the heavier part: and therefore ſhould flow downe, till they had obtained an equall height on every ſide from the Center. Now if we grant, that theſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23886:27"/>
waters ſupplying that equall ballance, are ſhut in, that they cannot flow out: yet two inconveniences would follow; the one, that being ſubject to corruption, they would infect thoſe things next unto them, and ſhould not be ſo uſefull for humane things as they ought: the other, that the earth having drawne their ſubſtance into her bowels, or being by little and little extracted by exhalation, they ſhould abandon their place, and take away that equality that retaineth the whole, that it cannot budge one way nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Which if any one will maintaine that the Waters may be there conſerved, wee will anſwer that in vaine are employed a great number of meanes (wherein there is more operative labour, and to the reſt unprofitable) to doe that which may be done without the ſame: and indeede both more compendiouſly, and more profitably. Whereby then the ſentence ſtandeth faſt, that the machine of the earth is in it ſelfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ballanced without budging one way or other, and conſequently alſo the Sea, which is contained within the boſome of it. And alſo that the Sea is in continuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leſt it ſhould be corrupted and infect the aire, and kill the fiſhes. Moreover, it waſheth the Earth both within and without, that all things ſhould be cleane and wholeſome: all corruption being conſumed and diſſipated by motion and attrition. The conſtitution of the weight of the Center, and of the world importeth all theſe things: which if they had beene knowne, and examined by the ancients, they had judged almoſt true, that which is of the ſituation, and greatneſſe of the continent of the new land found out in our age: and the Meridionall continent, not yet diſcovered ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate under the Pole Antarticke. For ſeeing that the lands knowne to the continent, and comprehended in a hundred eightie degrees of longitude, that is to ſay, doe onely poſſeſſe the one halfe of the Sphere, it was neceſſary there ſhould be alſo as much land in the other halfe. And ſeeing that Aſia, Europe, and Africa, for the greater part, are ſituated beyond the Equinoctiall towards the North, it was neceſſary as great a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to remaine under the Pole Antarticke, which ſhould be equivalent in the other lands, with the meridionall parts of Aſia, or new India or America.</p>
               <p>God (as ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi>) called the dry land <hi>EREZ,</hi> ſeparated from the Waters, and prepared for the life of living creatures, that is to ſay, the Earth and the Waters ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, <hi>MAIM,</hi> that is the Seas. But it is not to be thought, that ſo ſoone as this ſeparation was made, he gave theſe names no more than before, the names of the day, of the night, and of the heaven. For to whom ſhould hee have told them, when as man (whom it chiefely concerned to know theſe workes) was not yet crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? Vnleſſe any will maintaine, that they were told to the Angels. But I hold for an aſſured truth that here is inſinuated another, and a very great myſterie, to wit, a teſtimony of the immenſe love, and moſt loving and bountifull converſation of God with man, whom with a ſingular purpoſe, and affectionate ſtudy he created. For I thinke that this manifeſtation of names, ſignified not that preſent day it was, but after in a familiar conference with <hi>Adam.</hi> For when God brought the creatures to <hi>Adam</hi> that he ſhould give them names, there is no doubt but he had longer ſpeech with him, and treated with him amply of the Creation: naming the light, the day, the night, the heaven, the earth, the ſea, the Moone, and principall parts of the world: by meanes whereof hee might leave to his poſteritie the true Hiſtory of all this great worke; as alſo to be conſerved in ſome meaſure after <hi>Adam,</hi> even to <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This word <hi>EREZ</hi> (that I may uſe the words of <hi>Auguſtine Eugebine</hi>) properly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth that which is trampled and troden upon, derived of the word <hi>RAZAZ:</hi> the letter <hi>Aleph</hi> added according to the proprietie of the Hebrew tongue, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtateth the counſell and intention of creating the earth. For it was created, to the end that the moſt excellent creatures, for the which all things were created might tread, and walke upon it. <hi>MAIM,</hi> which is as much to ſay, as reaſounding, braying, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuating; commeth of the verbe <hi>Hamah,</hi> which ſignifieth, to bray, cry, and make a noiſe. From this deduction therefore of the ſaid <hi>Augustine,</hi> it appeareth, that <hi>EREZ</hi> and <hi>MAIM,</hi> ſignifie ſuch an earth, and ſuch waters, which is now the earth that ſerveth as a payement to terreſtriall creatures, and a ſtay to them which walke and reſt upon it; and the vaſt ſea, which being gathered together by the exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration of the Rivers, hath a perpetuall fluxe and refluxe roaring and making a great noiſe. And truely, ſeeing the Latine word <hi>Terra,</hi> is derived of <hi>tero,</hi> it anſwereth very properly to the word <hi>EREZ.</hi> Note this alſo, which the ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,

that the word <hi>TEHEMON,</hi> is derived from the ſame verbe <hi>HAMAH,</hi> and ſignifieth, the reſounding, or tumultuating Abiſſe, or deepe: therefore by the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the name, thou underſtandeſt that ſeparative winde, which in the ſeventh Chapter I have declared to have beene incontinent from the beginning in the Chaos: nor any other ſpirit but this blaſt, to be underſtood to have agitated the whole maſſe; and therefore the diſtinction of the water from the earth, to have beene made partly in a naturall manner.</p>

Common ſenſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all things created into three claſſes, or rather degrees; into thoſe things which have a being; thoſe things which have life or facultie vegetive; and thoſe things which have ſenſe. Which diviſion well underſtood and conſidered, agreeth very elegantly to our ſubject, and aideth greatly our ſpeculations, and giveth underſtanding. In the firſt degree, it behoveth not to underſtand one naked eſſence, without all forme, qualitie, and efficacie, ſuch as the Philophers dreamed the firſt matter to be: for I have ſhewed that God never created any ſuch thing, but it behoveth to underſtand the things, the which whatſoever they are invertue and power, yet are they without all motion: that in whatſoever place they are, there they reſt, there hang, there by themſelves they remaine immoveable, neither doe aſſume to themſelves any augmentation, or, to ſpeake more plainely, which have not in themſelves force of encreaſing: but as nature firſt formed them, ſo they are, and remaine, not having in them any life. In the ſecond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree are all things which have in them the firſt degree of life, to wit, facultie vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and vertue of encreaſing, and aſpire no higher unto life. In the third degree are thoſe things which (beſides vertue vegetative) have alſo ſenſitive, and move them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their owne proper vertue, according to the condition of their ſence. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the degrees of the Creation proceede from the firſt matter: and becauſe the vulger opinion is, that the ſpirit of man (by which onely hee differeth from bruit beaſts) is not created of the firſt matter, but particularly and ſingularly of God: they doe put man himſelfe in the number of other living creatures, and comprehend him in the third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of creatures. But when I ſhall have ſhewed in his place, that even the ſpirit of man is extracted out of the firſt matter, by intermediate degrees of perfection, it will appeare that wee muſt conſtitute in him a fourth degree of creatures. Therefore the firſt degree is of thoſe things which are. The ſecond of thoſe things which are, and have a vegetative vertue, which is the firſt degree of life. The third, of thoſe things which are, which live, and have ſence: and by ſence move voluntarily. The fourth of thoſe things which are, which live, have ſence, underſtand, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: for the ſuperiour degrees comprehend the inferiour. To theſe foure degrees it behoveth a Philoſopher diligently to apply his minde, and aſcending, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by theſe degrees, to obſerve the order of the Creation. Neither yet is it to bee imagined, that all thoſe things which are of the firſt degree were procreated before things which are of the ſecond: for it was not neceſſary that precious ſtones, and mettalls ſhould be before hearbes. For we muſt ſet downe this in the firſt place: that thoſe things were firſt to be created, which were firſt moſt requiſite for the uſe of man. Pearles and mettalls, though they had beene created long after man, could bring nor cauſe no diſcommoditie at all unto him. But thou wilt ſay unto me, it was neceſſary thoſe things to have beene created before the ſeaventh day; thou ſaieſt well, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, it is to be judged, thoſe things then to have beene created, when God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23886:28"/>
the earth to engender them: for the earth is ordayned to be the mother of theſe things, and remayneth mother, and in her ſelfe, and of her ſelfe conceiveth ſeed, whereof ſhe produceth perpetually theſe things, and according to her fecundity per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth them in their time. But the tardity and ſlowneſſe of the perfection of a new ſpecies, doth not hinder generation; becauſe it is the laſt and doth not engender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently. For if one pearle ſhould procreate another pearle, and one mettall another like unto it ſelfe, then was it neceſſary a ſpecificall and ſeminary vertue to have beene given to mettall, and pearle: which was the proper worke of the Creator, and not of the earth. So had it beene alſo neceſſary, that pearles, and mettals ſhould have been perfected, and received from God into them, a ſpecificall vertue before the ſeaventh day. So that we obſerve the order expreſſed in the generation of the world, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that it behooved to have beene made, the third day; for there ſhould have beene a like manner of engendring, both in the one, and the other: and both the one, and the other, ſhould have beene numbred in the ſame degree: to wit, of things vegita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and alike increaſed in growth, the one, as the other. Therefore ſeeing that the Seminary faculty of theſe things conſiſteth in the earth; although ſome aſiſtant, and (perhaps) formative vertue come from the celeſtials; it is to be thought that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe things was then perfected, when the ſeminary property, and generative vertue was given of the Lord to the earth which nevertheleſſe according to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall progreſſe of things it is credible was done the third day, when as the earth was ſufficiently made ſolid, and the ſtarres now next had received their compleate forme. No inconvenience therefore doth from thence ariſe if mettals, and pearles, and all things which in like manner are engendred of the earth, have not a proper ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of propagating their ſpecies: they are ſaid to have beene procreated certaine yeares after, when as the ſeminary property, and ſpecificall vertue, which maketh the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration compleate, was in the beginning given to the earth.</p>
               <p>Heere now is preſented a double conſideration of generation, which muſt be pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſtinguiſhed, to the end that the juſt order of the Creation, manifeſtly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> be not diſturbed: and that the reaſon of the order may be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne. There is one property of the generation of the ſame ſpecies, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes produceth his like, as a horſe produceth a horſe, a ſheepe a ſheepe &amp;c. to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry end of the world, becauſe it is done of its proper ſubſtance, and by its proper ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of engendring, Of the admirable myſtery whereof we will ſpeake in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter following. Another generation there is which engendreth not his like, but diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in ſpecies, according to the quality of the Spirits of a divers kind which concurre together. So the Earth engendreth gold, ſulphur, lead, and ſuch like things, unlike unto it ſelfe and of another Species: the vertue whereof it hath in it ſelfe from the Creation, and not after, not doth acquire it any where elſe; but from the worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter the Creator.</p>
               <p>You ſee then a double generation of Species, of the which that which is made of the ſame Species, requireth alſo the perfection of the ſpecies within ſix dayes of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whereby it may receive from the Creatour this ſpecificall faculty of engendring, which neither the Earth, nor the heaven, nor any ſpecies before created can give: it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belongeth to the Creator, to communicate this vertue to the ſpecies that are created. And therefore although that the waters had produced the firſt ſpecies of fiſhes, and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foules, yet he did not make the ſame ſpecificall vertue perpetuall, &amp; proper to them all, but perfected the ſame vertue begun with the living Creatures, in the proper mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſame ſpecies, taken from the waters, &amp; imprinted in it, and gave it unto them, ſaying, <hi>Encreaſe, and multiply, and fill the waters of the Sea, and let foule multiply in the Earth.</hi> But whatſoever ſpecies received not this benediction, they could not be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed of themſelves, but have a certaine accidentary generation other where: to wit, of a certaine element, or elements, whereunto God hath imparted that vertue of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then no doubt when every of them, having obtained a perfect ſpecies, received al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his proper nature, and his proper ſpirit, as alſo he communicated this ſame vertue to perfect living Creatures. And therefore ſeeing that the ſpecificall vertue of theſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies was imprinted in the elements already perfect, it was not neceſſary to produce ſtones, pearles, mettals, and ſuch like to be conſpicuous before the ſeaventh day; for their Creation was already effected in the elements. Neither had they neede of any
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23886:29"/>
further creation; their generation depending now naturally from the elements.</p>
               <p>Now theſe degrees of things being conſtituted, let thoſe who are ſtudious of the farther ſecrets of Philoſophy, take diligent heed, which of theſe are moſt noble, and by what order, by what alſo, and how many meanes they are brought to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their Species. But becauſe the underſtanding, and reaſon, adde ſomething above ſence, and motive vertue, and this hath more than the vegetative: and againe, that this is the firſt acceſſe of thoſe things which are unto life, it is eaſie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that by the ſame order that theſe degrees are numbred, they are alſo formed and enabled by nature. We have an example of all in the generation of man, in whom the ſpecificall vertue imprinted by the Parents in the ſeed, and therein produced, firſt, formeth the body, and the entralls, which all the while till the heart be formed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the firſt degree; but ſo ſoone as the heart is formed receive a vegetative nature, and beginne to attract to themſelves nouriſhment, and to grow, but in the end almoſt of ſixe weekes, having obtained the third degree, they moove: and then truely, can a man diſcover no appearance at all of underſtanding, or of a reaſonable ſoule in the fruite, even from the firſt conception: if we grant that the ſoule was engendred of the Parents, but then as yet it is formed, and finiſhed laſt, as being the moſt noble. All generation then proceedeth from the ignoble to the more noble, and is perfected by the ſoveraigne degree of every Species, nor doth aſcend further. For nothing is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to overpaſſe the bound of his ſpecies, becauſe further forces of extending it ſelfe, are not given to it, but the benediction of generation is terminated in the ſame ſpecies. So thoſe things which onely are, although in nobility they excell others in their kind, yet they cannot attaine to the power of growing. Of thoſe things which have the faculty vegetative, ſome are more noble than others: but they cannot attaine unto ſence: and living creatures, whoſe marke in their ſpecies is ſenſe and motion, doe not attaine unto underſtanding: for this ſurpaſſeth all things, and repreſenteth the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God.</p>
               <p>The ſame order (now Reader) thou wilt obſerve to have beene kept in the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of things: for hitherto God hath created the things which are: hereafter, (the more noble ſubſtance being taken from theſe) he will create thoſe things, which are of the ſecond degree, to wit, hearbes, and plants; that done, living creatures, which are of the third degree, and among them; firſt, thoſe things, which come from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and more ignoble, after the terreſtrials, which being endowed with a more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, dry, and warmer ſpirit, are alſo more ſubtile in ſenſe, and approach ſomething to the underſtanding: Finally man himſelfe, who ſhould have the dominion over the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in reaſon and wiſedome: So the more noble are laſt after all created, becauſe they have neede of a more noble matter, and more purified and digeſted, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are later perfected: nature, which was firſt created, alwayes working ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſpirit, and manner given him from Gods Idea. But the Idea of God, is the worke of his wiſedome, the will of order, vertue, and proportion of things to be created, and ſuſtained. In ſumme, if any man will ſearch more diligently the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things, and conſider the communion and difference of Species, he will perceive that the Creation of things (beginning from the more baſe and ignoble Species) ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt aſcended upward, as a tree hath at firſt but onely a truncke, wherein all things which are from the roote to the very top, are but one and the ſame thing by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Species, every of the parts in the meane time having their veines therein: but when they beginne to have any difference among themſelves, the firſt diviſion of the truncke is made into branches, after (every branch remayning a certaine time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till their veines divide themſelves one from another) is made the ſecond diviſion, and ſo conſequently untill we come to the laſt branches and fruits. So the Chaos is the onely truncke of all the Species to be created, having his roote and beginning in the univerſall Idea Creatrix, which is in the mind, and divine will. In this truncke all things as yet are one, lying hid and communicating in the ſeminary propriety of the Chaos. Furthermore, as this univerſall Idea, creatrix of things, by the diviſion of the ſpecies into their determinate number and forme, aſcending by little and little, doth divide it ſelfe, ſo of one ſimple ſpecies of Chaos without forme, the difference of ſpecies by little and little doe ariſe, for ſo long the ſubſtances of all the deſtinated ſpecies remaine one, untill they tend perfectly to the difference in that wherein they
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23886:29"/>
communicate. Whence thoſe things which as yet communicate, being contained in one branch, doe cohere and ſticke together, untill they come into the way of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpecies, every one following their owne high, and extreame, and perfect ſpecies. So there being of all the parts, as through all the branches of the Creature, made all excoction, diſtillation, purification, extenuation; ſublimation, or after what elſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this laſt act, tending to the extreame end of operation, is to be named, at length we come to all ſpecies conceived. But that is to be remembred, that thoſe things which are of a moſt high degree are more ſlowly perfected. Seeing they aſcend by intermediate degrees. So a living creature ſeeing he aſcendeth by three degrees, to wit, by being, and by a vegetative ſpecies, even unto ſenſe and motion, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that that which is vegetative be perfected in one degree firſt. For ſo it is to be thought of that univerſall Idea, which is in God, that it doth ſo make its impreſſions in the Creation, that beginning from the truncke by inconfuſed order, and right way, it doth by little and little goe by the leſſe noble, and more noble ſpecies, to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the higheſt, and perfecteth together thoſe that are of the ſame degree: after thoſe which are of a ſequent, and more noble ranck, as we ſee in the creation of plants, living Creatures, and of man.</p>
               <p>Now the ſpecies, which conſiſt in one degree, or are of one kind, as in the kinde of plants, the willow, and the Oake; are diſtinguiſhed by certaine degrees, or by a kind of excellence, and nobleneſſe one from another, wherefore there is ſome thing more perfect, and more noble, and later effected in the one than in the other, thence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that the Oake groweth and increaſeth more ſlowly than the willow, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe the Creation of the Oake was finiſhed the third day, as well as that of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. For (as we ſhall anon ſee) the ſpecificall vertue is brought forth together with the bud of the hearbe, and imprinted in the plant by the Idea formatrix. For the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things which are like to engender like to themſelves, is finiſhed by theſe two, to wit, by the ſame ſpecies, and by the ſpecificall vertue, that is to ſay of propagating the ſpecies: the encreaſements which follow after, and the generation of fruits are naturall workes of the ſame ſpecies, which follow that vertue and the Creation. But heere it behooveth to remember what we have ſaid in the ſeaventh Chapter, which is, that ſo ſoone as the matter of any thing was prepared, there withal together the ſpecies of things to be created was brought forth; although the thing it ſelfe was of later growth, as the Sunne begunne to be Created the firſt day, when God Created the light, and yet was not perfected till the fourth day. So the waters being prepared, the ſpecies of fiſhes begunne to be created the third day, and the earth being dryed up, the ſpecies of terreſtriall living creatures: and yet theſe things were not perfected till the fifth day. So the third day the ſpecies alſo of hearbes, and plants began to be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and yet were not finiſhed till the fourth day. For <hi>Moſes</hi> onely noteth the time when the workes were finiſhed. The ſpecies therefore of plants, and of terreſtriall living creatures, were brought forth when the earth, the mother of them, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly finiſhed: but the things of a more ſolid ſubſtance were finiſhed, as the Oake the fourth day did grow later than the hearbes. Theſe things concerning the degrees and order of things to be created and conſidered, come we now to the creation of plants, which is the other part of the worke of this third Day.</p>

Foraſmuch as man, and the other living Creatures, were to live of hearbes and fruites, the creation paſſeth to the ſecond degree of things, which is the firſt of life,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:23886:30"/>
and becauſe they were to ſerve for their nouriſhment, God found out a meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould be multiplyed by ſeed, and ſpecificall vertue, or propagative, which God bleſſed that they might ſuffice unto all living Creatures. For although the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of multiplication be not added, a man may well underſtand that it was done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath annexed it to other Creatures and <hi>verſ.</hi> 29.30. of the ſecond of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> he giveth theſe things there for foode to all living Creatures.

When he ſaith, <hi>Let the Earth put forth her bud,</hi> it is certaine that the hearbe and the tree had not their perfection in the ſame inſtant that he ſaid it, but both the one and the other, by the ſpecificall Idea, and benediction of God, from one point, and at once (as it were) of the Earth; no otherwiſe then from a ſeede (which being but ſmall, hath yet all its vertue in the leaſt part, and bud thereof, which is contained and lyeth hid in one of the ends) commeth to burgeon, bud, and by little and little to grow into a great plant, or tree.</p>
               <p>Now that we are come to the firſt degree of life, it is neceſſary firſt to ſearch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and proſecute the nature and condition of the Spirituall ſubſtance, from whence life taketh its beginning. As I have ſaid from the ſixth Chapter, that all things are come by evaporation, and exhalation from the Chaos: afterwards the elements being ſo prepared for generation, and the celeſtiall things for influence, the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Creator tooke the Atomes of vertues, or the leaſt particles of the water and the earth, whereinto he put a ſpecificall vertue according to the Idea's, and according to the number of the Idea's comprehended in his wiſedome, and withall added the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction of engendring their like, to the end they might multiply the ſame ſpecies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perpetually conſerved. But the ſpirituall ſubſtance is the more noble part of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or generative body, which attracting nouriſhment, converting it into its nature, and protruding it forward to the increaſe and growth of the body, hath vertue from the benediction, and from nature. So the Earth, the water, the ayre, and other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, exhale from themſelves a ſpirituall ſubſtance, by meanes of the heate, which by the ſpecificall ſubſtance of the ſeede is converted into the ſame nature and ſpecies, and affordeth encreaſe, and growth, or motion, and ſenſe, according to the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpecies. The like ſubſtance when it is engendred in the bowels of the earth, and produceth its ſpecies within the earth, doth not bring any encreaſe at all to the ſpecies, but is coagulated, curdled, and bound together into it indiſſoluble, not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be disjoyned from it: neither doth exhale otherwhere, diffuſing its odour, or vertue, but onely by contraction and operation of the permanent quality. So Gold is coagulated and joyned together in the quality of the Spirituall ſubſtance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not encreaſe, but rather is contracted by the ſulphureous heate, that it may be made more ponderous, and weighty. Stones are in like manner engendred. Hearbes and trees, ſeeing they are to grow and increaſe, have a more ſoft nouriſhment, apt to extend: therefore alſo they exhale and yeeld odours and vertues, and at length by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little are conſumed, being come by growth to maturity. This ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is that alone which preſerveth its ſpecies (I meane that which is in the plant, not that which is without) for this being firſt attracted, and drawne from that, is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the ſpecies and afterward doth nouriſh it, and conſerve it: and doth nouriſh it ſo long time, as there is nothing which corrupteth the ſame ſpecies, conſerving al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes the ſame characteriſmes, and markes of leaves, of flowers, branches, and fruites; the odour, ſavour, colour, and other accidents, ſo firmely, that if but a little ſlip, or bud, be graffed into another plant, there alſo will it follow its owne naturall property, changing all its nouriſhment into its owne ſpecies. But all the nouriſhment
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:23886:30"/>
ſo attracted; is changed into the forme of that part whereunto it laſt commeth. So the juice of a tree being come to the fruite, is changed into the ſpecies of fruite; being come to the leafe, is changed into the ſpecies of the leafe. And the nouriſhment of the living Creature, when at laſt it is attracted to the liver, is converted into the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, when to the rootes of any muſile, it paſſeth into its ſubſtance, and ſo of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and every member draweth unto it ſelfe, that which is moſt fit for it ſelfe. But ſome things which are unfit to nouriſh the body, nature expelleth, ſome into haire, ſome into nailes, ſome into ſcabs, others otherwiſe: or quite out of the body. Some things which by a hidden vertue are appropriated to ſome part of the entrals, doe ſtrive thitherward by a naturall property. Therefore this ſeminary and ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, is a thing very divine, wherein there is from the Creation all ſpecificall facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and vertue formative, wherein is ſtirred up by meanes of the heart all motion of the body neceſſary to the living Creature, that the vertue thereof might be ſtill ready to aſſiſt all the extreame parts of it: and doth afford like ſeede for generation, that the continuation of the ſame ſpecies may remaine to the end of all things. But wee muſt know and conſider this, that the ſame ſpecies doth not come by influence from the ſtarres, but from that into the which God firſt put it, and whereunto he gave the benediction of generation: the Starres ſurely are a helpe, but the originall and roote of all ſpecies, is in theſe inferiour things. But ſeeing that this world is (as it were) one body, having harmonious parts among themſelves, and conſpiring together in one, as alſo all living creatures, to the image whereof, and of God, man (as a little world) was created, bearing the Image of God, and having like Oeconomy of parts; it is credible that the world hath alſo the Sunne for its heart, as the beginning of all life, and that it had its being from the beginning, when the light was created, and that it performeth the ſame office in the world, within the Concavity of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that the heart doth in man, cheriſhing all things above, and below, by its heate and light, and that therefore it hath beene placed in the middle of the world, or a little higher, even as the heart in man.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>OD hath given ſuch a ſeminary ſpecies throughout the whole world, where the temperature of the element was proper thereunto, that the vertue of that ſpecies was never anywhere wanting; for the Plants do not change their place, nor walke upon the earth like living creatures, but abiding in their place, doe there caſt mature ſeede: neither was care of tranſplanting them impoſed to man, as to whom all things neceſſarie preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves voluntary and of their owne accord. And ſeeing that the wiſedome of God hath created nothing in vaine, and without cauſe, which is not profitable to ſome neceſſitie of life, it was moſt certaine that there is not any diſeaſe, nor defect of nature, for the which hee hath not provided a moſt propitious remedy. Wherefore he hath cauſed to bud and ſpring ſo many ſpecies of Plants, as was needfull for the conſervation and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation of the life of man, and of all living creatures, and placed the tree of life in the midſt of Paradiſe, to the end that man by the uſe thereof, might preſerve his life in health, untill, being made more divine by the exerciſe and obedience of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, he might be tranſlated into heaven.</p>

Which alſo a man might ſhew more at large, ſeeing that beaſts themſelves inſtructed by nature, have ſhewed to mortall men the vertues of many hearbes knowne unto them. But hee hath created in every region ſuch ſpecies of Plants, as are moſt agreeable in temperature to men, and living creatures there borne, which by experiments is often proved; ſo that by the onely abundance of Plants which one ſeeth ſpring, a man may almoſt perceive to what popular (that is to ſay, ordinarily diſeaſes) every region is ſubject. So among the Danes, Friſes, Hollanders, who are much ſubject to that diſeaſe, commonly called <hi>Scorbut,</hi> there is in abundance the hearbe called Cochlearia, as a proper medicine to that diſeaſe; ſo in mariſh places. So the Tamariske acknowledgeth the native ſoile: the inhabitants are expoſed and ſubject to the indiſpoſitions of the ſpleene, as their pale colour ſheweth, which is diſcovered in their ſwelling skinne, and puffed up Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondries. In like manner is obſerved that in thoſe quarters where Wormewood groweth about hedges, in courtyards, the inhabitants are ordinarily affected with the obſtructions of their entrals, weakeneſſe of the ſtomacke, and ſuffuſion of the gall, that if the paſſages of the entrals be not opened by the uſe of the ſaid herbe, and ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and made firme by the evacuation of the gall, they come firſt to have the Iaundiſe, and after, by little and little, endender water betwene the skinne and the fleſh. And although that ſome things are contrary and venimous to ſome, yet being uſed in their kinde, they are healthfull; ſo of the very worſt poiſon, is made the noble treacle, and there is nothing created ſo averſe from the nature of man, the uſe whereof is not ſome way or other profitable. Now let us treate of the ſeede. God created the hearbes and the plants of the Atomes of the earth, by the worke of the wiſedome, Idea, and benediction of God; but ſo he created them as they now ſpring of ſeede, for there is the ſame operation of the firſt generation, as of the ſecond ſeeing the ſame ſpecies is, and remaineth.</p>
               <p>As then out of the ſeede groweth the plant, ſo it is produced of the Atome of the earth, formed by the Idea into a certaine ſpecies: and on the contrary. And from the ſeed a little young bud, contained in one of the ends thereof: in what part it maketh the point of the ſeede, it attracteth the humour of the Earth, or of the water, and formeth one little roote or more, according to the property of the ſpecies, and the nouriſhment being attracted by them into the other end of the ſeede produceth the trunke, and thereafter the branches and leaves, that adhere unto it. But the ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vertue is in this little young bud, which changeth into its nature and ſpecies, all the nouriſhment which it attracteth. The ſame reaſon is in the terreſtriall Atome, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Idea, for it produceth its buds no otherwiſe then doth the ſeede. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, as this nouriſhment attracted, is carryed higher, ſo is it more and more chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the forme of that which ſpringeth from it, into branches divided from the truncke, into leaves, into flowers, and into fruites. The moſt perfect of all is the fruite, wherein is perfectly accompliſhed the ſeede which is given for the multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ſpecies. And the higher things excied to encreaſe by the heate; doe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract juice from the inferiours, but the roote not able to adminiſter ſufficient nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the higher, taketh new attractive rootes: whereby it gathereth nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more copiouſly. Hence it followeth that thoſe plants which have more rootes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their higher parts have neede of more nouriſhment, and their fruites are more moiſt, except the rootes be of greater uſe then their fruites: wherein the divine wiſedome hath provided for the uſe of the living Creatures, So the hearbes, the rootes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are ordayned to be eaten, attract more juice, and their rootes are more ſucculent, and more groſſe: nature procuring encreaſe principally to rootes, and not to hearbes: thoſe that are more long, are ordinarily of a more dry and a more fat ſubſtance: as thoſe which ſeeke a more dry nouriſhment at the bottome. From the accident, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of rootes, many things may be obſerved, which appertaine to the ſearch of nature, and of thoſe hearbes. But in hearbes, the juice attracted is carryed upward by the parts not yet changed: but in trees, by the barke, as being more ſpongious, till
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23886:31"/>
that (having ſtayed there a certaine ſpace of time) it be changed from the neerer part, and that which is moſt noble, and more purified, is then carryed upward into flowers, into fruites, and for ſeede. Many ſpeculations will preſent themſelves heere to one that will ſearch after them. Now that the juice attracted is ſo carryed upward, as I have ſaid, the graffings of young ſcienes in trees, teacheth us ſufficiently; for in them the humour attracted is firſt communicated to the barke of the young ſcienes, there ſtaying ſome ſpace of time, doth unite the barkes of the young ſcienes to the barkes of the ſtemmes, and after conjoyneth wood to wood: but the ſpecies which is in the ſtemme, is changed into ſpecies of the young ſciene, which is engraffed. So ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the commandement of God, the ſame ſpecies produceth alwayes the ſame things, whether from the ſeede, or from the young ſciene engraffed, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bringeth forth branches, leaves, fruites, and ſeed, according to the nature of the ſpecies. It is not unprofitable alſo to conſider, in how long time, and how long ſpace from the earth, the fruit and the ſeed come to their growth, and with what humours the plants are delighted above the rootes, and what they avoyd: and (if it be poſſible) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner the juice is changed through every degree, in the roote, in the trunck, in the leaves, in the flowers, in the fruite, and in the ſeed: for ſo the nature of the ſpecies may be more exactly knowne. This at leaſtwiſe is acknowledged, that the nouriſhment of the plant, is much more noble in the fruite, than in the plant: but moſt noble in the ſeed, as that which is the end and ſcope of the Creation of all this ſpecies.</p>
               <p>Now by thoſe things we have already ſaid, a man may gather, that divers hearbes and trees have beene created in divers regions, and experience teacheth, that there be ſome in America, or new India, which are found no where in this our continent, Aſia, Affrica, and Europe; which have not beene in the uſe of men untill ſome travelled thither, which I ſuppoſe was after the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. In like manner there be there living Creatures, which are not at all found in our continent, which without doubt have beene there from the Creation of the world. Whereupon I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that theſe lands were not overwhelmed with the Flood, when God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy mankind, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. unto <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. For no men at all were there, and therefore the living Creatures there Created, and there inhabiting, ought not to be deſtroyed, as man was to periſh, whom it repented that he had Created, ſeeing that in living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he found no cauſe wherefore they ought to be deſtroyed, But in this our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent the living creatures ought to periſh; except ſome had beene preſerved in the Arke, for they were not able to live in the waters.</p>
               <p>When therefore God Created heere and there throughout the world the vertue of the tree of life, by one and the ſame meanes he provided, both for the one, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſtate of man; for that of innocency, and the other of ſinne; and the vertue of the tree of life in paradiſe, or diſperſed throughout the world was not for nought. For the world comming to be repleniſhed with men, all ſhould have had acceſſe to the tree of life: but the hearbes and the plants growing heere and there; had beene equivalent and man had a certaine choiſe, and the benediction had diverted all ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Seeing then that they were moſt wiſely created for the uſe and ſervice of man, aſwell in the ſuperiour, as in the inferiour world, what a faire harmony was there then? when the lower things did accord with the higheſt, and expected helpe from them; and the higheſt communicated their gifts to the loweſt, and all things ſerved man, untill he ſhould be tranſlated of God into his heavenly habitation. This correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency, this beauty of ſtate had continued immutable if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, yet this ſame harmony, if one conſider it more diligently, is as yet diſcovered in the traces of their firſt nature, for there is nothing ſo little which doth not ſerve to ſomething, and which doth not depend of one more perfect: all things are for man.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore all things tend to their end and ſcope, and that ſcope (that is to ſay man) conſiſteth of divers parts, which yet keepe among themſelves a moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able harmony, as that wherein life conſiſteth: of thoſe ſome ſerve to the ſtomacke, ſome to the liver, ſome to the heart, ſome to the blood, ſome to the reynes, &amp;c. wherefore there are ſo many ſimples, or plants, as there be entrals in man, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of them. And ſeeing that every thing changeth into its ſpecies the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:23886:32"/>
that it attracteth, and that there are divers ſtations in mans body, and divers wayes to every extreame ſtation, by the which the nouriſhment paſſeth, as in the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, the liver, the blood, the ſpleene &amp;c. thoſe ſimples are ſtronger, or paſſe ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as friends by the middle ſtations, which carry their vertue, entire even to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames, and there worke: and as for thoſe which cannot be there changed by nature, either they are venemous, or noyſome to nature. Thoſe things which are changed in the firſt ſtations are friends to nature, or of ſmall vertue. Thoſe which of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire vertue penetrate, unto the extreame ſtations, being friends to nature, are they which are more appropriate to that member, or to that part of the entrals, and have certaine characters, whereby they may be knowne, if a man take diligent heede. For we ſee that thoſe which reſemble nature, greatly communicate alſo in figure, as O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyons, Garlike, and ſuch like, have a forme of a ſmall ſcallion for their roote, and produce almoſt alike hearbe upward, if their flowers differ in colour this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe by a certaine difference and peculiar property that is in them.</p>
               <p>So there are many hearbes and trees which have dented leaves about like a Sawe, which for the ſame cauſe ſo bud, and therefore they have ſomething alike in nature, wherein they doe agree. Many hearbes alſo and plants have their leaves not dented about, but terminated equally; many that are dented, grow pointed, many round, as rue, many ſharpe edged, hard, and pricking, as the yewe tree. All ought diligently to be obſerved, for they are not ſuch by caſualty, but by nature ſo producing them perpetually: wherefore ſeeing nature produceth nothing temerary, raſhly, and the cauſe of the ſame figure is created to be perpetually the ſame, it is neceſſary that many things, by a certaine law of ſpecies, are alike, and have a certaine communion of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Moreover ſeeing there is a conſpiration, and ſociety both of celeſtiall and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall things, tending to the ſame ſcope and end, which is man: and the celeſtiall are eternall, and the ſpecies alſo in this inferiour world are eternall, having alwayes the ſame generations in forme, and in figure, and depending every one of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per celeſtiall cauſes; it is neceſſary that taking heede to the characters of the plants, a man doe gather, and obſerve many things which have reſpect to one and the ſame Starre, and many things alſo participating of the ſame nature (among the Phyſitians) in which things they have a mutuall correſpondence, as in figure, colour, taſte, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther qualities: for ſo, by the reſemblance, a man may learne to judge of the nature of things. For every nature hath its proper character, which it ever keepeth alike, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Heavens communicating its vertue thereunto. Theſe things according to my ſpeculation (ſuch as it is) I was deſirous to admoniſh the Reader, that he might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance by his ſtudies, a thing above all other moſt profitable, wherein <hi>Salomon</hi> obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned much praiſe, 3 <hi>King.</hi> 4.33. For why may not a man ſearch by ſtudy and induſtry the things which are before his eyes, and follow perpetually in figure, and in forme, the ſame law of nature? It is a laborious worke indeed: but labour overcommeth all things.</p>
               <p>I have heard the moſt learned <hi>Reinerus Solinander,</hi> Phyſition to the illuſtrious Prince <hi>Iuliers,</hi> diſcourſing moſt accurately and pertinently touching the charecters of hearbes: who I would God he would proceede to take ſome paines in ſo neceſſary a part of Philoſophie (if there be any able to doe it, it is he, being of that great dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of judgement, in the ſearching out of the nature, and cauſes of things) we ſhould have in briefe the demonſtrations of the characters, and hidden apparitions of them to every part of the entrals.</p>
               <p>Therefore while God doth conſtitute every where the vertues of the tree of life, the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.2. <hi>The workes of the Lord are great, ſought out of all them that have pleaſure therein:</hi> he doth alwayes direct to his ſcope or end, the worke which he had preordained: be it that <hi>Adam</hi> obeyed the firſt commandement, or not obeyed, and that in ſoveraigne wiſedome, mercy, goodneſſe, and juſtice.</p>
               <p>After that, according to my ſmall underſtanding, I have treated of the nature and varietie of Plants, there is one ſoveraine miracle of nature very remarkeable; which is that ſo many things which are in every ſpecies, as for example, the greatneſſe, the forme, the figure, the odour, the taſte, the colour, the leaves, the ſinewes, the rootes, the barke, the vertue; and infinite things which are in one onely plant, are hidden in one ſo ſmall graine of ſeede as I have ſaid. For all the vertue of the ſpecies is hid in one
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23886:32"/>
ſo ſmall a graine, when as that little graine hath nothing in it like unto all that, no not any appearance at all, but is wholly homogeneall, of the ſame kinde, and appeareth altogether of the ſame nature. Wherefore me thinkes I judge aright that the moſt ſimple Idea which in the beginning formed the ſeede accompanieth as yet the ſpecies, and continueth the ſame worke untill generation ceaſe. And this is that which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.17. <hi>My father worketh hitherto, and I alſo worke.</hi> Whence it appeareth that there be a Sabbath, or reſt from the creation, yet is it not from the ſuſtentation of the Creatures, but that this worke endureth even to the end of all things: I doe not ſee what other thing can be here ſaid.</p>
               <p>He that is curious of this ſpeculation, let him conſider chiefely what accidents are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to every ſpecies, and ſearch out the cauſes of them if he can: in the firſt place that he give good heede to the figure, and that he obſerve by what order the growth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is made from the roote unto the top: in what manner alſo it doth proceede, and is diſtributed by the barke, by the veines, and by the ſinewes, even to the compaſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and ſo at length without doubt, he ſhall finde out the proper character of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: The end of the third Day.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the creation of Lights was not perfectly finiſhed till the fourth Day, yet they begun to be created the firſt Day, that is, evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no other light that diſtinguiſheth the day from the night, than that of the Sunne: as verſe 14. that property is aſcribed unto it: and now three dayes are already paſſed, wherefore that light which diſtinguiſhed the firſt day from the night, without doubt was that light of the Sunne to come, diſperſed as yet, but contracted into the Hemiſphere of heaven, environing the whole Chaos, and which from the beginning tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the Poles of the world. So that the firſt day, the heaven and the motion thereof, together with the light begun to be created. For in the fourth verſe it is ſaid, that God ſeparated the light from the darkeneſſe; which could not make the day and the night, but by the collection of the light into one part of heaven, and extending it to Paradiſe. Therefore, ſeeing the day followeth the night, the creation of the light fell to be in that moitie, which was under the Horizon of Paradiſe, where becomming more ſtrong and more collected, by its motion towards the Weſt, aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the orientall part of Paradiſe above the Horizon thereof, and made the Day. But the collection of the ſubſtance of the Sunne, of the Moone, and of the Starres, was not perfectly finiſhed, till the fourth day; for <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribeth the time when the workes were fully finiſhed, which dependeth, and is defined from the perpetuall Will of God. Yet the Sunne (which I have ſaid before, Chapter the twelfth, to be the heart of the world, even as the heart is in living creatures) ought to have beene created before all things: therefore he begun with the firſt Creation of the light. But the Sunne having received a moſt cleare, and lucide ſubſtance, obtained the dominion and rule of the day; the Moone of the night, as not illuminating the night by its owne light, but very little, yea in the whole Ecclipſe thereof when the aire is cleare, yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth the circle of it, but the light very ſmall. But the Starres and conſtellations, ſeeme to have a ſtronger light, but farre inferiour to that of the Sunne.</p>
               <p>That is to be obſerved which he ſaith, that the lights were placed in the firmament of heaven: and verſe 8. <hi>He calleth the firmament heaven,</hi> whence a man may gather, that the Chaos was created much leſſe than the world now is, and from <hi>Aphar,</hi> and (as it were) a ſlimie Abyſſe of the Chaos, the matter being educted and extenuated,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:23886:33"/>
was elevated upward, and by little and little, as it departed farther from the Center, being made more and more ſubtile and noble, as it extended it ſelfe, begirded and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the more groſſe Elements. And ſo the Empyriall heaven was made the moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and noble, as being the throne of God, and the habitation of the bleſſed. Vnder that the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> the firſt moveable, a heaven a little more groſſe, and leſſe noble. Vnder that the other Heavens and Planets, which by how much nearer they are to the earth, by ſo much they are of a more groſſe and leſſe noble ſubſtance, leſſe extended. So that the heaven of the Moone is the moſt groſſe, and next in condition to the elements. This expanſion or entending, maketh the ſuperiour things lighter, and the ſeparation of them from thoſe that are more groſſe; maketh them more noble. Moreover, the luminous matter which was prepared for the ſubſtance of the Starres and lights, was not extended, but contracted, that they might ſhine more ſtrongly, and become more conſpicuous. So it commeth that the Starres are of a thicker ſubſtance than the reſt of the heaven, yet equally light, becauſe it is fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and alſo thicker, that the light might be the more ſtrong and powerfull, and the reflexion of the beames; caſt from the other Starres, which doth illuminate the night: eſpecially that which is reflected from the Moone; but that light which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected from the Sunne, doth divide the day from the night.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe offices of the two lights, it is added, that they may be for ſignes, and for ſeaſons, and for dayes, and for yeares. Here the Aſtronomers by ſignes underſtand certaine aſpects of the Starres, whereby things to come are betokened: but they erre greatly, for that wherefore the lights were created, is of farre greater moment than the divers divinations of the Aſtrologers, to wit, that men, whom God had lodged in this edifice, might learne to know the omnipotencie and goodneſſe of their Creator, which <hi>David</hi> ſheweth very clearely, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handie worke.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 1.19. That which may be knowne of God is manifeſt in them, for God hath ſhewed it unto them: for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible things of him, from the creation of the world are clearely ſeene, being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the things that are made, even his eternall power and God-head. Theſe two lights therefore are for this cauſe chiefely ſet in heaven, that by theſe workes of God, the omnipotency, majeſtie and divinitie of the Creator might be made knowne unto men, and not to the intent they ſhould ſerve for the vanitie of Aſtrologers. Moreover, they are given for the deſignation of times, when they are to be changed. So they will demonſtrate the end of times, and judgment of the world, when they ſhall be obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and deſolved. So at the time of the paſſion of Chriſt, when the time of the Law was to be changed, <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Areopagite ſaw the admirable ecclipſe of the Sunne. And <hi>Ioſhua</hi> perceived the admirable hand of God by the Sunne, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.13. They are alſo ſet to define the dayes and the yeares. The Starres alſo, which by night adorne the heaven above, doe alſo illuminate the earth below, and by their poſition ſhew the annuall circuit of the Sunne. The end of the fourth Day.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſecond degree of things having beene treated of, now is handled the third, concerning things which are, which have vegetation and motion: and firſt of thoſe which come from the waters, which are of a leſſe ſolid ſubſtance, doe more eaſily encreaſe, and are not ſo long lived, which are divided into many ſpecies, and every one of them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender among themſelves the ſeede of their ſpecies from the which ſpecies comming to maturitie, and diſperſed, the ſame ſpecies groweth: but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23886:33"/>
of every Species, have alwayes the ſame characters or markes. So that there is alwayes the ſame number and figure of the bones, the ſame colour, the ſame forme of body and of other members, the ſame force, nature and ſavour, as alſo in hearbes and in plants, but divers ſpecies have alſo divers impreſſions of characters; differing in figure, or ſome accident: of which difference, if thou canſt gather the cauſe, thou mayſt contemplate more nearely the proper nature of every ſpecies. For the proper nature of every ſpecies maketh different impreſſions of the Characters, and this doth follow the other as from the effect a man may gather the cauſe, and from the cauſe, the nature. In the contemplation of foules, the ſame things offer themſelves to be conſidered. But becauſe that the ſubſtance of foules is more ſolid, and conſequently longer lived, therefore alſo the workemanſhip of them was later finiſhed this day: although they begunne to be formed together, when the waters were gathered into the Seas. For the matter of every thing being prepared, inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent the Creation proceeded, and ceaſed not till all things were fully finiſhed, and the Sabbath, or reſt from all the worke of the Creation was come. For there is no cauſe wherefore the matter being once prepared, the Creation of things ſhould be ſuſpended. God Created many things as well as one, and the naturall order of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting things, is elegantly obſerved. The Starres alſo, which ſerved more neerely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, were now alſo the precedent fourth day perfectly finiſhed, that they might the more powerfully conferre their aid, than when the hearbes were created. So the nature of things Created, ſo ſoone as it was prepared, began to exerciſe its office, and all things co-operating together, the Fabricke of the world went forward. Oh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable wiſedome! which ſufficed for the creating of the order, the nature, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, the perfection, and the vertues of ſo many different things, and all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtudy or reaſoning! for he ſpeaketh the word, and they were made. It ſhall be good heere to make an anatomy of every one of the ſpecies, that it may be knowne in what things the impreſſions of the characters of every one are different, and in what manner, and by how many ſtations the nouriſhment is changed into the ſpecies, in what ſtation the blood is created in fiſhes. Thou ſhalt find alſo in fiſhes, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable providence, a little bladder full of aire incloſed in it, which taketh encreaſe together with the fiſh, whoſe office is to ſuſtaine it pendant, in what part of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſoever it be, leaſt by the weight of the body it ſinke to the bottome. Thou ſhalt find alſo in females many egges, which being broken againſt the rockes, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the vertue of nature forced out, come to multiply their ſpecies, and even as the ſeede of the plant, being caſt beyond its mother (ſeing it hath a ſpecificall vertue in it ſelfe) produceth the ſame ſpecies in its element: be it in the Earth or in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So alſo theſe egges of fiſhes being caſt into the water, there receive life, and ſhew the ſame ſpecies, and the ſame character of their mother. Neither ſhall it be unprofitable alſo to rip up the ſeverall ſpecies of birds, and to conſider their inferiour parts, and the functions of every one of them, that the cauſes of the impreſſions of the characters, and the originall of their proper nature may more rightly be knowne. In the which are procreated egges one at a time, and are excluded, having for there coverture a ſhell ſomewhat hard, leaſt the ſpecificall vertue ſhould more eaſily come to exhale: the which alſo being ſeparated from their mother, keepe their ſpecificall vertue, and being hatched by the heate of the mother, or alſo by ſtoves, as is uſed in Egypt for the ſpace of ſixe moneths, or a moneth produce birds of the ſame ſpecies. Moreover, they are conceived by the copulation of the Male and Female, as other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Creatures. But heere heede is to be taken principally to the difference of fiſh, and of foules, that though they were perfectly finiſhed in one and the ſame day, yet doe they not conſiſt of the ſame matter: but foules becauſe they reſemble more terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all living Creatures, as is manifeſted by the blood, and by the whole conſtitution of their body, they have more terreſtriall ſubſtance than fiſhes, that they ſeeme to come of muddy water, and fiſhes of more pure water. Foules therefore are of a middle rancke betweene terreſtriall living Creatures, and fiſhes; nearer to the nature of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall living Creatures, than of fiſhes: and therefore later this day finiſhed. But there is one thing moſt worthy to be obſerved in all living Creatures, that is, that they doe imitate in ſome ſort the ſhape of man; whole nature (as it were) tending to the forming of man, and not having its entire perfection but in man, for although

they have a longer head, they are furniſhed with all inſtruments in ſome ſort alike, for ſence, and motion; the bones of the head are alike, their backe bone anſwereth in ſome ſort to the backe bone of man, and their ribbes to his ribbes, and all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are formed according to the nature, and operation of every one.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE have ſeene two ſorts of the third degreë of things created, Fiſhes and Foules; now followeth the third kinde, terreſtriall living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which how much the later they were created, ſo much the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker are they unto man, both in ſenſe and motion; but in reaſon man ſurpaſſeth them all, they being deſtitute heereof. But of terreſtriall living Creatures ſome are more like man then others, as they write of the Elephant, that it is a docible beaſt, and commeth neere to man in underſtanding; What ſhall we ſay of the Ape, which ſporting imitateth mans actions? is angry, laugheth, applaudeth, ſeriouſly ſmelleth, warily beholdeth a thing, as deliberating whether it be good to eate; crackes nuts with her teeth like a man, and while ſhe is buſie about her owne worke, lookes upon the by-ſtanders what they doe: ſhe hath head, feete, and hands very like thoſe of man, and in all things, is that amongſt living Creatures, which commeth neereſt the characters, and nature of man. For this cauſe it were not amiſſe diligently to conſider the anatomy of this Creature, and to examine how much and in what, the interiour diſpoſition thereof differeth from that of man; that the animall vertues may be knowne by the inward impreſſions. For I thinke that thoſe depend upon theſe, or being after a ſpeciall manner engraffed by nature, are by impreſſion of the character, as by a fit inſtrument ſtirred up unto action, which yet ſeemeth ambiguous and doubtfull. For it appeareth that every thing hath in it ſelfe a certaine principle of its owne nature, which dyeth with it, ſo that the cauſe of the nature of every thing is created together with it, and is not from elſewhere. But we muſt anatomize every ſpecies, that the inward difference of all living Creatures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, may be perceived, and the difference of the animall vertues may appeare, from the diverſity of the impreſſions of their characters, ſo ſhall you finde out, for what reaſons, the vertues animall are more excellent in foules, than in fiſhes, in beaſts than in foules, in men than in beaſts, and underſtand a moſt excellent order, from things leſſe ſolid; from the leſſe perfect, to the more perfect, from the leſſe lively, to the more lively; from things temporall to thoſe eternall.</p>
               <p>All living creatures are nouriſhed of ſuch things as the earth bringeth forth, every one chooſing naturally what beſt agreeth with his owne nature, and this is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be knowne. For although the nature of every one changeth his nouriſhment into his ſpecies, yet is there ſome vertue in hearbes, and fruites, which turneth and altereth the ſaid aliment into their owne nature, eſpecially where there is affinity of natures, and eaſie digeſtion, yea they can alſo change venime, and corrupt it: but by the force of a contrary nature. Birds alſo feed on fiſhes, as being in kind nearer them, and every thing delighteth in that which comes nearer the nature thereof, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that which is of the ſame ſpecies, which every living Creature loveth, man one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted, who hath forgot his originall. Venimous beaſts, beſides their nature good for ſomething, have this commodity, that they every where ſucke up the vemine, and are nouriſhed with it, but other beaſts devoure them without harme, ſo well hath nature provided for the ſafety of living Creatures. But heere remaineth one queſtion to be anſwered: whether that the ſame condition of living creatures which

And to what end ſhould they have beene immortall, when they were onely ordained for the ſervice of man? ſeeing ſuch infinite encreaſe ſhould have beene for no uſe: They had reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced man undoubtedly, and beene obedient to him, for God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28, 29, 30. made <hi>Adam</hi> Lord of all things under Heaven.

But this conformitie, and hermonie, is ſo farre as concerneth the animall part of man.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, there is a thing farre more noble in man, that hee exceëdeth the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of all creatures, to wit, the reaſonable ſoule, according to which he was created after the Image and the ſimilitude of God. And becauſe man, according to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is a reaſonable creature, and received a bleſſing that he ſhould encreaſe and multiply by the generation of his ſpecies: there is no doubt but from that bleſſing, he hath alſo received power to beget a reaſonable ſoule, which is the chiefe part of the ſpecies. Which that it ſhould be new created in every man, is not agreeable, ſeeing God the ſeventh day ceaſed from all the workes of his Creation, and then kept the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>And there are yet in this inferiour world, the reliques of that matter, of which the celeſtiall and ſuperceleſtiall things were created, ſo that there is a naturall inclination, and ſympathie, of the ſuperiour world, unto the inferiour, and a reſpect and deſire of the inferiour unto the ſuperiour. For from hence alſo dependeth the proclivitie and cooperation of things ſuperiour, unto the inferiour. The thing moſt noble, that is in the higher world, is the Empyriall heaven, or thoſe ſuperceleſtiall waters, out of which I have ſhewed the Angels to be created. So that the reaſonable ſoule may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got of the reliques thereof, in this inferiour world: and why may it not, ſeeing gold which is corruptible, is begot of the farre more groſſe and ignoble matter of the earth? Therefore the eternall and immortall ſoule, may much rather be begot of the reliques of the ſuperceleſtiall waters, that it may be like unto Angels, and the bleſſing and commandement of God gave power to beget the ſoule of ſuch reliques, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate and multiply the ſpecies. Now ſee what gifts of the holy Ghoſt or God are in his ſoule. Here are underſtanding, reaſon, judgement, memory, love of what is true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, juſtice, joy in the holy Ghoſt, free election of will, and what elſe. For in theſe things he beareth the reſemblance of God and his Image, in the immortall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the reaſonable ſoule. For man was created in this order and manner, firſt he formed the humane ſhape of <hi>Aphar,</hi> or clay, in which undoubtedly thoſe bowels which are firſt made in generation begun to be formed, as the heart, then the liver and thoſe things which depend immediately upon the heart: Which being formed he breathed into his face the breath of life. All living things draw breath through the mouth and noſtrils, whereby the heart is kindled with life and motion; ſo through the mouth and noſtrils he breathed ſpirit, which was without queſtion of the reliques of the ſuperceleſtiall waters; or ſome part of them was firſt conceived in the maſſe or lumpe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:23886:35"/>
of the body, of which the reaſonable ſoule by the holy Ghoſt accompanying it, was at length formed: but firſt the animall life was produced by the common aire. For the reaſonable ſoule; ſeeing they have different offices the one from the other: and the animall ſoule going before, the rationall remaineth, and the animall ſoule is a certaine harmonie, and common operation of the interiour entrals, conſpiring to the life of the animall; as for the rationall, it is the Image of the divine eſſence. But that the animals have obtained life, it commeth to paſſe undoubtedly by the Spirit of God working with the like blaſt of aire; although it be not ſaid ſo, for it is eaſily underſtood, that in like things God hath wrought after a like manner. The gifts which the reaſonable ſoule, brought with it, were neceſſary in man, if he ought to be the Image of God; that he might contemplate the workes of God, and might acknowledge, adore and worſhip his Creator. For the knowledge of God was required unto the ſcope of the creation of man; for what bleſſedneſſe had he had with God, without the knowledge of him? Seeing therefore he knew the chiefe power and goodneſſe of God, and that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and familiarity of God was pleaſant to him, God would trie him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that was enriched by him with greateſt gifts, whereby he could obey God, would acknowledge and reverence God his Creator: for ſo bountifull a father requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red voluntary and willing obedience and love, whereby to be worſhipped, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne ſervice received from him. He gave him an eaſie command, that he ſhould not eate of one tree, where there were ſo many full of the beſt fruits, for ſight and taſte, that hee ſhould onely abſtaine from that, and it is credible, that he obeyed God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while, for as many thinke, he remained not in Paradiſe one houre, or ſome dayes or weekes.</p>
               <p>It is likely rather that he remained ſome yeares in the obedience of God, as <hi>George Cedrenus</hi> thinketh, that being ſollidly taught the workes of God, by the helpe of the holy Ghoſt, and longer contemplation, he might declare them to his poſteritie: And ſeeing men then lived long, the true doctrine of God, by the tradition of a few, to wit, three (<hi>Adam, Methuſalem,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi>) came to <hi>Abraham,</hi> by whoſe holy covenant with God, it was eaſily preſerved in the poſteritie of <hi>Iacob,</hi> even unto <hi>Moſes.</hi> But ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie too much prevailing about the time of his birth, God would by the deſcription of the chiefe of his workes by <hi>Moſes,</hi> reduce men to the acknowledgement and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of one onely God. Here then is propounded to our contemplation, the generation of the world, which he deſcribed partly by tradition, and partly by the revelation of the holy Ghoſt; whereby we may attaine the true and perfect deſcription of the whole world which we ſeeke for. He had without doubt frequent talke with God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was taught concerning the creation, the nature of things, Gods counſell, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which were neceſſarie for man to know. God brought to him the living creatures, that he might behold them every one, and give them names according to ther nature; which could not be done in a ſmall ſpace of time. <hi>George Cedrenus</hi> in the abridgement of Hiſtories, ſaith, ſome ancients were of opinion, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned not, nor was caſt out of Paradiſe, untill the ſeventh yeare, and makes it probable by good reaſons.</p>

in vaine, but that the Serpent was a lier, and juſtly throwne downe from heaven. For it is not to be doubted, but that he had much converſation with God in Paradiſe, and divers diſcourſes whereby he was inſtrctued concerning the Creation, and nature, and the end of all things. Yea acknowledged the power of God from ſo wiſe a Creation, and the right judgement given againſt the Serpent, that of right he ſhould not have given eare to the Serpent, and that it was folly for him ſo to doe: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe in this he did not ſinne againſt God, becauſe God had not forbidden it. For it made for the greater glory of God, if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned: for then had man given a certaine teſtimonie of himſelfe, that he was well created, as all things were very good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. He could have interrupted the ſerpents ſpeech, and rejected him, and he had not ſinned. It was the beginning of ſinne, but it was not ſinne that he gave eare to Sathan, for God had not forbidden this, and as yet he had power to contradict him: but his longer patience and familiarity cauſed conſent, and he forthwith ſinned by tranſgreſſing the commandement, wherewith the holy Ghoſt offended, left him, and ſpoiled him of his gifts, which he had received in the Creation, and were preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in him by the holy Ghoſt, ſo long as he did not ſinne, God conſidering the event, but not approving it, becauſe he had forbidden it, and <hi>Adam</hi> ſo making experiment of his conſtancie. Of this lapſe <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> writeth moſt plainely, and moſt truely, <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>verſe</hi> 14. God created man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his counſell, giving him theſe ordinances and commandements, if thou wilt thou ſhalt keepe the commandements, and teſtifie thy good will. He hath ſet before thee fire and water, put forth thy hand to which thou wilt. Life and death are offered unto man, good and evill, which he pleaſes ſhall be given unto him. But now, ſince God knew before that he would ſinne, why did he not create him ſuch a one, as could not fall? God did all things well and like a father. It was his favour that man was adorned with ſuch excellent gifts of minde, that he might eaſily obey ſo ſmall a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and man of right ought to have beene thankefull for ſo great gifts by obeying his Creator. He could therefore as <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> ſaith, have ſtood if he would, but that he fell it was not of God predeſtinating or willing, for God had created all things very good, and Fatherly ordred them. So when he ſinned, he was deprived of the holy Ghoſt, which dwelt before familiarly with him, from whom he had life not mortall, if he had not ſinned, who had ſuſtained him in holy life by the grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God: being deſtitute therefore of the familiar preſence of the Spirit of God, he perceived nothing in himſelfe but carnall affections, whereby his minde being drawne away, (as is evident by <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.15. and the <hi>verſe</hi> following, and 24.) he alſo was made carnall, that is, addicted to the concupiſcence of the fleſh, as being conſtituted in the ſame ſubſiſtence, for he ſaith, there is another law and neceſſitie in the fleſh, than in the ſpirit or underſtanding; and that it draweth the ſpirit captive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſervitude. And that which is captive, is not in its owne power, but is ſubjected to the power of another. He ſheweth then that the ſpirit in the beginning was not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall but became ſuch when it was made captive to the fleſh. It is altogether neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to know, and obſerve this originall of originall ſinne, that the ſpirit from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was not created carnall, or fraile, or unable to reſiſt evils, for this would ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the impotencie of the Creator, that he could not create man fit for that end which he had conceived, and would violate his authority. Now what calamities are accrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto mankinde from this ſinne, learne from that place of Saint <hi>Paul, Chap.</hi> 7. for if the fleſh could doe ſo much againſt the Spirit, adorned with ſo many abilities, and preſerved by the holy Ghoſt, what ſhall it not doe againſt the ſame ſpirit made cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thereunto, and forſaken of the familiaritie of the holy Ghoſt. Heare what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.12. of all, both Iewes and Gentiles, <hi>They have all gone out of the way, they are all become unprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> He ſpeakes of mans natures alone, but when it is Chriſt, and man is helped of the holy Ghoſt, he is not ſuch, the naturall gifts of the minde, underſtanding, reaſon, judgement, memory, and other gifts ſuffice not, if the ſpirit be not preſent, the ſupporter and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of theſe. But the concupiſcence of the fleſh is not onely a privation of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, but a true inclination to thoſe things which pleaſe the fleſh, from whence all ſinnes ariſe, and therefore that inclination is called originall ſinne. Now if it were onely a privation of righteouſneſſe, <hi>Paul</hi> had no occaſion to exclaime: <hi>Wretched man
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:23886:36"/>
that I am who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death? Rom.</hi> 7. For a regenerate man is freed from his minde. But in the regenerate ſinne originall yet abideth, which is an argument, that originall ſinne is more then a privation, and an evill which clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to nature, and is propagated by generation. <hi>In ſinne</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt) my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceived me.</hi> But God foreſeeing that this ſinne would come upon man, ſaid, <hi>In that day in which thou ſhalt eate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evill, thou ſhalt die the death;</hi> for this ſinne was to be expiated with the death of the body. Therefore it is a law unto all once to dye, to the end, that that which is come upon them beſides the creation, may be aboliſhed in thoſe that are to be ſaved. As for Paradiſe, where it was, and what the Rivers thereof, I will ſhew in the ancient reformed Geography. Man having beene created out of Paradiſe, was tranſported into it.</p>

From this foreknowledge, God uſing his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull providence, ſo finiſhed the Creation of all thing, that in both eſtates, of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and the fall, he preſerved for man the meanes to obtaine eternall life, ſo that nothing was made of God in vaine, onely the death of the fleſh remayned, which was due to originall ſinne, untill that was taken away from man altogether, and he being wholly pure, as he was Created, might come to God, according to the end wherefore he was Created.</p>
               <p>Moreover, becauſe all men were guilty of orignall ſinne, as I ſhewed in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter, ſo that they could not by the gifts of nature, come unto Chriſt, God therefore ordayned Repentance, Baptiſme, and Communion, the chiefe Sacraments, whereby man before all the world, might yeeld himſelfe unto Chriſt, and by faith might approove and accept his ſacrifice for the ſinnes of man, whereby he might be armed againſt the force of ſinne, be delivered by this onely meanes, from the power of originall ſinne, and obtaine the helpe of the Holy Ghoſt againſt the force there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet the fight with ſinne remaineth ſo long as wee live, till it be aboliſhed by the death of the fleſh, on which the originall thereof dependeth, and therefore the death of the fleſh was enjoyned of God, becauſe of the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> that that ſinne which is beſides the Creation, might be rooted out: by meanes whereof, man is ſaved, yet is there no acceſſe unto God the Father, but by Chriſt. It is written, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.13. <hi>No man aſcendeth up to Heaven, but the Sonne of Man, who deſcended from Heaven.</hi> The way was to be opened by Chriſt: And it behooved Chriſt to ſuffer, and to enter into his glory, <hi>Luke</hi> 24, 26. That therefore I may adde that which of many is not rightly diſputed, before the incarnation of Chriſt, none of the holy Fathers aſcended into Heaven, but were reſerved in a certaine place of joy and happy expectation, untill the comming of Chriſt. This place, the Fathers called <hi>Limbus,</hi> not that of Hell, but as I ſuppoſe, that of the Heavenly Paradiſe, in which <hi>Abraham,</hi> as Father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, was moſt eminent, into whoſe boſome or Congregation <hi>Lazarus</hi> after his death was carryed by the Angels. But after the death of Chriſt they were brought into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, according to his teſtimony. Father I will that where I am my Servants may be

alſo. So that Chriſt Ieſus in his time, aſcended with his ſpoyle, and captivity into Heaven. Therefore this originall ſinne and fight therewith, continueth unto the death of the fleſh; but by faith in Chriſt we are armed and preſerved againſt it, by the helpe of the Holy Ghoſt, as <hi>Adam</hi> had beene preſerved if he had not ſinned. Becauſe of the ſight thereof with the Spirit, <hi>Paul</hi> cryeth out <hi>Wretched man that I am who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> (to wit, that is aſſayed thereby) I thanke my God (ſaith he) by Ieſus Chriſt, whom the Father hath given me for a Saviour, and an Helper by his Spirit, till this ſinne be utterly aboliſhed in the death of the fleſh.</p>

                  <p>The other two Zones remaining are called temperate, and accounted habitable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are placed betweene the cold and the hot, and participate of the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them both; the one whereof is called Septentrionall, ſhut in betweene the circle Articke, and the tropicke of <hi>Cancer,</hi> or the Crab: the other is called Auſtrall or Meridionall, bounded with the circle <hi>Antarctique,</hi> and the Tropicke of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> both which containe 43. degrees.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is another way alſo to divide the ſuperficies of the earth, to wit, by the change and the diverſitie of the length of dayes, for thoſe who inhabit right under the <hi>Equator,</hi> have perpetually the day and night of an equall length, juſt twelve houres long, but as much as is gained on this ſide, or on the other ſide of the <hi>Equator,</hi> lying towards the one, or the other Pole: So much in Summer the dayes encreaſe in length, and on the other ſide the nights are made the longer in Winter; for this cauſe the Geographers, according to the encreaſing of the dayes, have diverſely diſtinguiſhed the regions, or parts of the earth, which they call Parallels, or Climats.</p>
                  <p>Parallels are circles equally diſtant one from another drawne from the Weſt to the Eaſt, any man may ſee them at his pleaſure, delineated upon the Globe of the earth. But <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who was followed by a great number of other Geographers, hath made twentie one Parallels, in that part which extends it ſelfe twards the North, keeping
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:23886:41"/>
this proportion, and internall; ſo that one of the longeſt dayes of a parallell ſurpaſſeth the longeſt day of the parallell precedent. The climate is a ſpace of the earth, between two parallels, in which on the longeſt day it maketh the change, or encreaſe of halfe an houre. But the word climate and and parallell ſignifie ſometimes a ſpace, comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded betweene two circles.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the climats are diſtinguiſhed into thoſe, which are Septentrionals, and the Meridionalls, either of them taking their beginning from the <hi>Equator,</hi> extending towards their proper Pole. Hence it comes to paſſe, that where the climate lieth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from the <hi>Equator,</hi> ſo many halfe houres, the longeſt day exceedeth the day e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the night, to wit, which is twelve houres, and going backward giveth you to underſtand, under what parallell, or climate every place is ſituated, you are to marke well the number of houres, of which the longeſt day in the ſame place, exceedeth the day of the right ſphere (which as is ſaid) is alwayes twelve houres; for this number being doubled, ſheweth the number of the Climates, and being quadruple, giveth you to underſtand the number of the parallel.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, antiquitie knew onely but ſeaven Climates, being of opinion, that that which was beyond the ſeventh climate, could hardly be accounted habitable, being not as yet diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Theſe climates tooke their denominations from the moſt renowned places, over which the middle place of the climates extended, namely, the firſt was called <hi>per Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roen</hi> or <hi>dia Meroes,</hi> which was an Ile lying upon the river of <hi>Nilus,</hi> and a city in <hi>Africa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Authors, who have found out by experience, that the earth was inhabited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond theſe above ſaid climates, have ſuppoſed five and twentie climates, reaching o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the 67. degree of the elevation of the Pole; the firſt was over <hi>Meroes,</hi> the ſecond over <hi>Syena</hi> under the Eſtiuall tropicke, the third over <hi>Alexandrino,</hi> the fourth over <hi>Rhodes,</hi> the fifth over <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> the ſixt over <hi>Millan</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> the ſeventh over <hi>Podolia</hi> and <hi>Tartaria</hi> the leſſer, the eighth over <hi>Wittenberge,</hi> the ninth over <hi>Roſtocke,</hi> the tenth over <hi>Ireland,</hi> the eleventh over <hi>Bohoja</hi> a fortreſſe in <hi>Norway,</hi> the twelfth over <hi>Gutie,</hi> the thirteenth over <hi>Bergin</hi> a towne in <hi>Norway,</hi> the foureteenth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Viburgh</hi> a towne in <hi>Finland,</hi> the fifteenth over <hi>Arotia</hi> a towne of <hi>Sweatbland,</hi> the ſixteenth over the mouth of the river of <hi>Dalenkaul,</hi> and the other which remaine over the other places of <hi>Norway, Sweathland, Ruſsia,</hi> and the places bordering upon the next Iles by the like internall. Now it is certaine that from the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> circle, to the place where the longeſt day is limited to twentie foure houres, it hath the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of twentie foure climates, but from this place to the Pole, the climates cannot be certainely diſtinguiſhed; becauſe that from thence afterward the dayes encreaſe in ſuch a ſort, firſt not by halfe houres, but from the beginning by whole dayes: after by weekes, and in time by moneths, ſo that under the Poles, one of the Hemiſpheres is enlightned and dried by the light of the dayes, which laſt ſixe moneths: the other by the like ſpace of time, is overcaſt with a thicke darkeneſſe and a continuall night.</p>
                  <p>For the reſt the ſame conſideration, which hath beene made of the climates from the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> towards the Pole <hi>Arctique,</hi> the like alſo muſt be obſerved from the ſame <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> on that ſide, which lieth towards the Pole <hi>Antarctique,</hi> in making alike number of them, nevertheleſſe, the Authors have given no other proper appellations to ſuch climes, but named them by thoſe which were oppoſite to them, adding this Greeke prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the diviſion of the earth into three hundred and ſixtie degrees, with the Longitude and Latitude thereof.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE circumference and roundneſſe of the whole circle, according to the Geometritians, is divided into 360. parts, and this ſame diviſion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the ſection of the Sphere and of the Globe. The earth then, as the ſphere is divided into 360. parts which they call degrees. Every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree is divided into 60. ſcruples, which make a thouſand <hi>Romane</hi> ſpaces, or an <hi>Italian</hi> mile, or an ordinary <hi>Almaine</hi> mile: ſo that every degree containeth 15. <hi>Germaine</hi> miles, and the whole counted together, make five thouſand and foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: which is the whole circumference of all the Globe of the earth: and its Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the halfe part thereof equally in two, is a thouſand ſeven hundred and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene <hi>Germane</hi> miles, with two elevenths: the ſemi-diameter, from the ſuperficies of the center, eight hundred fiftie nine, with one eleventh.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the degrees by which the earth is meaſured, are of two ſorts, the one of Longitude, the other of Latitude. The longitudes are diſtinguiſhed by the Meridian circles, and the Latitudes by the Parallels. There are thirtie ſixe Meridians, which are faſtned upon the Globe, every Meridian having tenne degrees, which number being multiplied, maketh three hundred &amp; ſixty <hi>Ptolomy</hi> hath placed the firſt Meridian in the fortunate Iles, which at this day are called the <hi>Canaries,</hi> ſince the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Pylots have placed it in the Ile of Goſ-hawkes, which their language is called <hi>Aſſores,</hi> and ſome of them placed it in the midſt of <hi>Spaine.</hi> From the <hi>Equator</hi> to the one or the other Pole, are marked out nine Parallels, each of them containing tenne degrees: then multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this number by foure, ye ſhall finde in all thirtie ſixe parallels, as in the Longitude: Now wee muſt hold that the Longitude is a certaine ſpace or internall of the <hi>Equator,</hi> cloſed betweene Meridians, the one from the Iles called <hi>Aſſores,</hi> from whence it taketh the beginning, the other from that place or Region, whereof we would know the diſtance. As touching the breadth or elevation, that is, a going backeward, or the length of a place or of a Countrey diſtant from the <hi>Equator,</hi> either towards the one or the other Pole. Alſo the elevation of the Pole is the ſame as is the Latitude from a place. But this Latitude is of two ſorts, the one is Septentrionall from the <hi>Equator,</hi> to the Pole <hi>Arctque</hi> in our Hemiſphere; the other is Meridionall or <hi>Auſtral,</hi> from the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator</hi> in the inferiour Hemiſphere to the Pole <hi>Antarctique.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>TLAS</hi> King of Mauritania, was borne of a Royall race, and had for his father <hi>Serrenus,</hi> or <hi>Indigena</hi> (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> witneſſeth out of the moſt ancient Historians) whoſe ſurname was <hi>Coelus,</hi> and whoſe mother was <hi>Titea,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Terra;</hi> his great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father on the fathers and mothers ſide was <hi>Elius</hi> or <hi>Sol,</hi> King of Phoenice, who with his wife <hi>Beruth,</hi> dwelt in Biblius, both of them excellently verſed in Aſtronomy, and in natural diſciplines, ſo that for their learning ſake, they were accounted worthy of the names of <hi>Sol</hi> and of <hi>Coelum;</hi> undoubtedly this <hi>Atlas,</hi> as the Ancients report (namely <hi>Diodorus</hi> in his fourth Booke and fifth Chapter) was a moſt skilfull Aſtrologer, and the firſt among men that diſputed of the Sphaere. He had many brethren to the number of fortie five, whom <hi>Coelus</hi> begat of divers women, whereof <hi>17.</hi> of them he had by <hi>Titea,</hi> a moſt prudent Matron, that did many good offices to men, whom he after their mothers name called <hi>Titanes.</hi> Hee had alſo ſiſters, among whom the principall were <hi>Baſilea,</hi> who in favour of her mother, brought up all her brethren, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they called her Grandmother, and <hi>Rea Pandora.</hi> Now after the deceaſe of <hi>Coelus, Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lea</hi> being the eldeſt, and excelling the others in prudence and vertue, by the common conſent of her brethren and the people being a Virgine and unmarried, ſhee obtained the kingdome. Afterwards being deſirous to leave an heire behind her, ſhe was married to her brother <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perion,</hi> and ſhe bare him two children, to wit, <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> whoſe prudence <hi>Hyperions</hi> bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren admiring to the intent the kingdome might not be ſetled upon his iſſue, they maſſacred him, and drowned <hi>Sol</hi> his Sonne, being yet an infant in the River of <hi>Eridanus.</hi> Then the Sonnes of <hi>Coelus</hi> whereof the nobleſt of them were <hi>Atlas,</hi> and <hi>Saturnus,</hi> ſhared their Fathers kingdome, betweene them. <hi>Atlas</hi> had for his part, thoſe Countries, which lay next unto the Ocean, and <hi>Lybia,</hi> and the ſtraights of <hi>Gibraltar;</hi> whence <hi>Mount-Atlas,</hi> and the Atlanticke people in <hi>Mauritania</hi> tooke firſt their name, and <hi>Saturnus</hi> obtained <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and <hi>Lybia,</hi> who being afterward hated of his people, for the crueltie he uſed againſt his father <hi>Coelus,</hi> fled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> where by <hi>Ianus</hi> he was made partaker ef the kingdome. Now for as much as <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> alleageth, that <hi>Coelus</hi> was the firſt King that reigned amongſt the Atlantickes, the people being before disperſed up and downe in fields in <hi>Colonies,</hi> he admoniſhed them, to gather themſelves together, and to build Townes. Without all queſtion theſe Kings were very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, becauſe <hi>Atlas,</hi> ſonne of <hi>Atlas,</hi> having chaſed away his brother, <hi>Heſperus</hi> was King of <hi>Iberia,</hi> which afterwards in the yeare <hi>738,</hi> after the univerſall floud was called <hi>Spaine. Heſperus</hi> flying into <hi>Etruria,</hi> where he was made tutour to <hi>Ianus.</hi> The Grandfather of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlas (Elias)</hi> reigned in <hi>Phoenice,</hi> anno <hi>662.</hi> after the deluge. And <hi>Diodorus</hi> witneſſeth, that thoſe Kings out of the nature of things, and the contemplation of them, attained to excellent knowledge, and withall became pious, and more humane, that as <hi>Diodorus</hi> truely ſaith, the <hi>Atlantiks</hi> bore away the Bell for their pietie, and humanity to ſtrangers, from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations whatſoever, when there were ſcarcely not above <hi>22.</hi> or <hi>23.</hi> generations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate, and many parts of the earth not yet inhabited. <hi>Atlas</hi> had many ſonnes, but among the reſt, one famous for his piety, juſtice, and courteſie to his ſubjects. His name was Heſperus, who aſcending up to the top of mount <hi>Atlas,</hi> to ſearch out diligently the courſes of the ſtarres, was on a ſudaine violently carried away with winde, and appeared no more. So much <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſpeaketh of him: but in my opinion (as I have ſaid) I find he was King in <hi>Iberia,</hi> into which at laſt, he came with a prosperous winde, where he lived ſo prudently, and religiouſly, that when he fled into <hi>Etruria,</hi> being driven from thence by his brother, for his excellent wiſedome and prudence, he was made Tutor to <hi>Ianus,</hi> and adminiſtrator of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, which offices <hi>Atlas</hi> his brother undertooke. My purpoſe then is to follow this <hi>Atlas,</hi> a man ſo excelling in erudition, humanity, and wiſedome (as from a loftie watch tower) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template Coſmography, as much as my ſtrength and ability will permit me, to ſee if perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture by my diligence, I may finde out ſome truths in things yet unknowne, which may ſerve to the ſtudy of wiſedome. And as the world containeth the number of all things, the ſpecies, order, harmony, proportion, vertues and effects; ſo beginning from the Creation, I wil number al the parts thereof, ſo far as methodical reaſon requireth, according to the order of the creation, and will contemplate phyſically, that the cauſes of things may be knowne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of conſiſteth that ſcience of ſciences wiſedome, which directeth every good thing to a good end,
<pb facs="tcp:23886:46"/>
by a provident wiſedome, which doth facilitate the way to the ends. This is the maine ſcope I aime at. Afterward J will handle coelestiall things in their ranke: then the Aſtronomicks; which appertaine to conjecture by the Starres. Fourthly, treate of things Elementary, and laſtly, the Geographicks, and ſo as (in a mirrour) will ſet before your eyes, the whole world, that in making uſe of ſome rudiments, ye may find out the cauſes of things, and ſo by attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto wiſedome and prudence, by this meanes leade the Reader to high ſpeculations.</p>

For the contemplation of Generals is pleaſant, and very neceſſary to him, who deſireth to have the leaſt knowledge of the World and naturall things. For if you pleaſe to conſider the manner of the riſing and ſetting of the Sunne, what is the cauſe of Summer or Winter, whence is the inequality of the Dayes and Nights, or laſtly, what hath beene the originals, or propagations of things, what hath beene the actions, the atchievements, the mutations, and converſions happening in any place, even from the firſt Creation, you ſhall learne all this no where better, than out of theſe five adjoyning Tables, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all danger, and with honeſt recreation of minde. And even as it is not ſufficient for any one, though hee have a large dwelling-place, to know the ſeverall parts of his houſe, as the Porch, the Wine-cellar, and Butterie, the Kitchin, the Parlour, the Supping-roome, the Bed cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the Cloſet, the Studie, &amp;c. whereby hee may uſe them conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently; but alſo it is fit and neceſſary, that hee ſhould know, in what part and ſtreet of the Citie his houſe ſtandeth, and thence hee may ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way diſcerne, if any fire or tumult happen in the Citie, how neare or

how farre he is from danger: So it is no leſſe neceſſary to know in what part of the world thou dwelleſt, what people are neare thee, and which are farther off, that when warre approacheth, thou mayſt know when to feare, and when to be quiet in minde. Laſtly, though <hi>Coſmographie</hi> be the light of all Eccleſiaſticall and Politicall Hiſtorie, and that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder may learne more from thence, than the Traveller by his long, tedious and chargeable labour, who often changeth his<note n="*" place="margin">Caelum non animum mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant qui trans mare currunt. <hi>Horat.</hi>

And <hi>Apuleius</hi> painting forth an admirable picture of it calleth it, That which conſiſts in the ſocietie of heaven and earth, and of thoſe things which belong unto their natures. The ſame <hi>Apuleius</hi> more elaborately deſcribes the world thus; or to this purpoſe. The world (ſaith hee) is a garniſhed ordinance of things, the juſt charge and cuſtodie of the Gods, whoſe pole, (for ſo I call the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) beeing ſtrong and immoveable, paſſeth through the earth, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and nouriſher of all living creatures.

Now that the forme thereof is gathered round together like a Globe, the name thereof doth declare, and the conſent of men calling and painting it in manner of a Globe; beſides diverſe arguments that prove the ſame: As becauſe ſuch a figure is moſt capable, moſt ſimple, and doth bend in all parts towards it ſelfe, ſuſtaines it ſelfe, includes and containes it ſelfe, wanting no joyning together, nor having any end or beginning in any of its parts: as alſo becauſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you behold it, it hath a circular forme in all its parts, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not happen in another figure.

For ſome are imperfectly mixt, which we call Meteors, as Hayle, Raine, Snow, Thunder, Lightning, Winde; others perfectly mixt, but without life, as Stones, Mettalls, &amp;c.

But concerning them we will ſpeake more in another place.<note place="margin">The commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of the Sea.</note> The Sea is not altogether barren, but bringeth forth Fiſh, Plants, and pretious ſtones, and it is to be noted how Nature, with <hi>Dedalus</hi> cunning, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in the Sea all the chiefeſt things which are ſeene either on the Earth, or in the Aire.

Their Grapes are like Sloes which grow upon thornes and buſhes, and are covered with blacke leaves: but becauſe they are more woody then juycie, therefore the inhabitants doe not make wine of them. There are in this Country Trees bearing Olives, but ſuch as are of an unpleaſant ſmell, and of a worſe taſte: and diverſe other kindes of fruits in great abundance, as thoſe which they call <hi>Hovi, Platani, Pineae, Guiavae, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mei,</hi> and <hi>Guanavanae;</hi> it bringeth forth Sugar, Cotton-wooll, Hempe, and other things as with us, beſide divers ſorts of ſtrange Trees and Herbes.

Wherefore it is no wonder if the inhabitants were ſtrucken with amazement at the firſt ſight of a Horſe.

It doth bring to us divers living Creatures, partly knowne to us, and partly unknowne.

Here are alſo Peacocks, Pheſants, Partridges, and divers other kindes of Birdes, but farre differing from ours: But of theſe wee will ſpeake more largely in our particular deſcriptions. All <hi>America</hi> is divided (as wee ſaid before) into two great <hi>Peninſulaes,</hi> whereof the one, which lyeth on this ſide of the <hi>Aequinoctiall,</hi> is called the Northerne <hi>America;</hi> the other the Southerne, becauſe the greateſt part of it is ſtretched out beyond the <hi>Aequinoctiall:</hi> although ſome Countries of it are neare unto the <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctill.</hi> The Northerne <hi>America</hi> is divided into many Regions, as namely, <hi>Quivira, Nova Hiſpania, Nicaragua, Iucatan, Florida, Apalchen, Norumbega, Nova Francia, Terra Laboratoris,</hi> and <hi>Eſtotilandia.</hi> There are many parts of the Southerne <hi>America,</hi> but theſe are the chiefeſt which have already been gotten and taken from the Savages: as <hi>Caſtella aurea, Plopaiana, Peruvia, Chile,</hi> and <hi>Braſilia:</hi> It doth glory eſpecially in two Cities, <hi>Cuſco</hi> and <hi>Mexico.

Here are foure eſpeciall Pallaces of Noble men, who doe governe the Common-wealth, which are ſtately and with great coſt built with ſquare carved Marble ſtone. And all the ſtreets being ſtraight, in many places make the forme of a Croſſe, and through every one a pleaſant River runneth in a channell walled on each ſide with ſtone. The forme of the Citie is foure ſquare, lying ſweetly on the ſide of a hill: on the ſteepe aſcent of a Mountaine, a wonderfull faire Tower doth adorne the Citie, whoſe beauty or largeneſſe if you conſider, thoſe which have viewed many Countries, have ſeene few in all <hi>Europe</hi> like unto it. <hi>Mexico</hi> or <hi>Temiſtitan</hi> is a rich and famous Citie in <hi>Nova Hiſpania,</hi> whereof wee will treate hereafter in the deſcription of <hi>Nova Hiſpania:</hi> now we proceed to other things. This part of the World is watered with many famous Rivers,<note place="margin">The Lakes &amp; Rivers.</note> the moſt whereof doe bring downe gold; and it is full of Lakes and Springs. In the Lakes and Rivers there are great plenty of fiſh: among which there is one kinde of them of chiefe note, which by the inhabitants of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> are called <hi>Manati.</hi> This Fiſh is ſomewhat like a Trout; he is five and twenty foot long, and twelve foote thicke, in his head and tayle hee reſembles an Oxe; he hath ſmall eyes, a hard and hairy skinne, of a light blew co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and two feete like an Elephant. The femalls of this kinde of fiſh doe bring forth their young ones, as Cowes doe, and doe let them ſucke at their two dugges.<note place="margin">The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</note> Here are alſo very many Mountaines, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which, as <hi>Benſo</hi> witneſſeth, is a fire-vomiting Mountaine, which out of its hollow mouth doth ſend forth ſuch great flakes of fire, that the blazing of it in the night doth caſt forth a light which may bee ſeene above an hundred miles. Some have ſuppoſed that the gold mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting within, doth afford continuall matter to the fire. For a certaine <hi>Dominican Frier,</hi> when he would make tryall thereof, cauſed a veſſell of gold to bee made with an iron chaine: and afterward going to the Mountaine with foure other <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he let downe the veſſell with the chaine into the hole of the hill; and there by the heate of the fire the veſſell with part of the chaine was melted: and having tryed it againe with a bigger chaine, it hapned to melt againe in the ſame manner. Here the Cities generally are ſtately built, the wayes paved, and the houſes very faire and beautifull. It is reported that here was a Kings garden, wherein herbes and trees, with their bodie, boughs, and fruits did ſtand of ſolid gold, and as bigge as thoſe which grow in Orchards. And it is reported that here was a Kings Conclave, in which there were all kindes of living Creatures, made of precious ſtones, partly painted, and partly inlaid, and engraven. That which is reported concerning the two wayes in this Country is worthy of memory, the one whereof lyeth through the rough Mountaines, the other ſtretcheth through the plaine fields, from <hi>Quito</hi> a Citie of <hi>Peru,</hi> to the Citie <hi>Cuſco,</hi> for the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23886:64"/>
ſpace of five hundred miles. The beauty of this worke is encreaſed, by many wonderfull heapes of ſtones, which were not brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ſtrength of Horſes, or Oxen, (both which the inhabitants wanted) but by the hands of men. The field way is defended on both ſides with walls, and it is five and twenty foote broade, within which little ſtreames doe runne, having their bankes planted with ſhrubby trees, which they call <hi>Molli.</hi> The other being hewed out of ſtones and rockes, paſſeth through the middle of the Mountaines, having the ſame bredth: Moreover the way in the uneven and lower part of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes, is fortified with fences, as the nature of the Country requires. Theſe wayes King <hi>Gninacava</hi> (who lived not long ſince) cauſed to to be clenſed, and the ruinous walls to be repaired and adorned, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the worke is more ancient, and there were placed all along by the way ſide Innes both faire, and pleaſant, (they call them <hi>Tambi</hi>) in which all the Kings traine were received.

This fountaine doth warme the neighbour gardens ſo that they continually flouriſh with divers kindes of flowers and herbes. And the Sea neare unto it, by the vertue of theſe waters, is never frozen, but lyes continually open both for the fiſh and the uſe of man: which makes ſo great a concurſe of fiſh to reſort hither from colder places, that not onely theſe Monkes,<note place="margin">Freezland.</note> but alſo the Inhabitants round about do live plentifully. <hi>Friſlandia</hi> or <hi>Freezland</hi> was an Iſland altogether unknowne to the Auncients: being greater than<note n="n" place="margin">

                     <note place="margin">Nova Zembla.</note> This Iſland in our time beginneth to be known again, &amp; that by the Diſcoverie of the <hi>Engliſh. Nova Zembla</hi> is an Iſland ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated under the 76 Degree. Here the aire is very ſharpe, and the cold moſt vehement and intolerable. It is a wild, woodie, and rugged Country, where neither leaves nor graſſe grow, nor any living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but thoſe which live by fleſh as Foxes, and Beares, whereof there is great ſtore not onely in this Iſland, but in moſt of the Northerne Countries. There are Sea-monſters here whoſe bodies does exceede the bigneſſe of an Oxe, and are commonly called <hi>Walruſchen:</hi> they are headed like a Lyon, their skin hairy, they having foure feete, and two teeth ſticking forth of the upper part of their mouth beeing ſmooth, hard, and white, and are worth as much as Elephants teeth. The <hi>Bayes</hi> here are called <hi>Weggates Bay, Forbiſhers Bay,</hi> and <hi>Daviſes Bay; Weigates Bay</hi> is ſtreitched out towards the Eaſt even to the place called <hi>Crucis An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus,</hi> toward the <hi>Aerctapelietes</hi> to the place called <hi>Diſsidii Angulus,</hi> a a little enclining to the Eaſt. On the Southerne ſide of the <hi>Continent</hi> of <hi>Weggats Bay, William Barendſon</hi> found ſome wild men called <hi>Samiutae.</hi> The ſhape of their cloathes which they uſe, is like that which our Painters do beſtow on woodmen, or Satyres, but yet they are not wild men, but endued with a good underſtanding.

They have coaches unto which they put one or two of theſe Rangiferi, which will draw it with one or two men in it with more ſpeede then any of our Horſes can do. <hi>Forbiſhers Bay</hi> was ſo called from <hi>Martine Forbiſher</hi> an <hi>Engliſh man,</hi> who in the yeare 1577. ſeeking a paſſage to <hi>Cathaia</hi> by the North, arrived at this <hi>Bay,</hi> in which hee found both Iſlands and many men, concerning which wee will adde ſome things. The men thereof being ſtrangers to all civilitie,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23886:67"/>
do eate and feed upon the raw fleſh of beaſts and fiſhes. They are cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with the skins of wild beaſts taken in hunting, and they eate raw hearbes like beaſts. Their Tents are covered with Whales skinnes; the cold being continually very ſharpe in theſe parts. They uſe Dogges which are like unto our Wolves, and having yoked them together, they do make them draw things over the ice. Their weapons are Bowes and Arrowes, and ſlings. There is no wood there, but much Deere. The men do not plough the ground, as beeing content with that it bringeth forth of its own accord: they live by hunting: their drinke is the warme blood of wild beaſts, or elſe ice water: there are no Rivers nor Springs, becauſe the violence of the cold doth ſo ſhut up the Earth, that ſprings of water cannot breake forth. The men are very laborious, ſtrong, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and cunning fowlers: they uſe a certaine kinde of boate made of leather, wherein one man can but ſit, who maketh uſe but of one Oare, his right hand holding his bow wherewith hee ſhoots at the birds. The like hath beene ſeene in <hi>England. Daviſes Bay</hi> alſo was ſo called from <hi>Iohn Davis</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who in the yeare 1585. and the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yeares did ſearch along the Coaſts of <hi>America,</hi> or rather the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne Coaſts of <hi>Greenland</hi> from the 53. Degree to the 75. to finde out a paſſage that way unto <hi>China.</hi> Concerning the foure <hi>Euripideas</hi> in the table thoſe things which you ſee are taken out of the Regiſter booke of <hi>Iames Cnoxen Buſcoducenſis,</hi> who doth report that a certaine <hi>Engliſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norite Frier</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> being a Mathematician, did deſcribe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries lying neare unto the <hi>Pole,</hi> and meaſured them with his <hi>Aſtrolabe</hi> in this following ſhape, as <hi>Mercator</hi> hath gathered them out of <hi>Iames Cno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xens</hi> Booke. Hee ſaith that theſe foure Seas are carried with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the Innermoſt <hi>Gulfe,</hi> that ſhips being once entred can never be driven backe againe with any winde, and that there is never ſo great a winde, as that it can drive about a wind-mill. But theſe things are as true as <hi>Lucians</hi> fables, ſeeing they who have viewed theſe places in which thoſe ſeas are ſaid to be, do finde no ſuch <hi>Euripi,</hi> or ſwift flowing Seas at all, namely the <hi>Hollanders</hi> who have diſcovered the Sea even to the 81. Degree of Latitude. But concerning the habitation of the Northerne people, let us heare <hi>Iulius Scaliger</hi> in his 37. Exercitation, where he thus ſpeaking concerning a voiage from the Northerne Sea towards <hi>China. There are</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>divers arguments brought by divers men on both ſides, and it is diverſly judged of, whether it be poſsible to ſaile by that Sea. But theſe are ours. They would have us to ſaile from the mouth of the River</hi> Duvina, <hi>all along that Countrie which encompaſſes all</hi> Scythia <hi>even to the Eaſt corner: in which winding courſe wee are to change the Northerne wind for the Weſterne. But thoſe which ſpeake thus, it is certaine they do not know the nature of this Sea, nor of the Windes and Coaſt: For the Weſt and Eaſt windes are ſo rare in this Sea that they are almoſt ſcarce knowne. But ſo many North windes are there here that it ſeemes Nature hath committed the government of theſe parts unto them alone. There are many foards blinde and muddie. In winter, which continueth ten moneths, the ſuperficies or upper part of the Sea, is as hard as any pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In Summer there are continuall miſts, which in the afternoone as faſt as one is expelled another riſes. Beſides, the Ice is very dangerous, the great pieces whereof floting up and downe, are like moving Iſlands running one amongſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> It is certaine that by the late Navigations of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23886:68"/>
yeare 1594. and in the two following yeares, it was hoped, that wee might ſaile out of the Northerne Sea to the Eaſtern parts of the World. But very difficultly, in regard of the Ice, and long winter nights. <hi>William Barentſon</hi> did denie that it was poſſible to ſaile by the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Naſſovia</hi> to <hi>China,</hi> not onely for the Ice, but alſo becauſe hee found by divers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, that it was not a Sea but a <hi>Bay,</hi> and eſpecially becauſe hee found there was no Tide nor Ebbe: and yet hee was in great hope that a way might be found out by the moſt Northerne part of <hi>Nova Zembla.</hi> But ſeeing there are every day new voyages made to diſcover the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that way to <hi>China,</hi> experience will teach them at laſt whether it can be done or not. It is manifeſt that our ſhips have ſailed even to the 81. Degree of Northerne Latitude, and yet found the Sea open: but yet afterward at the 76. Degree they have beene hindred with great pieces of ice, and the night comming on, ſo that they could proceed no further. The Sunne left them the 4. of <hi>November</hi> in the yeare 1596, and was ſeene again the 24. of <hi>Ianuary</hi> in the following yeare, all which time theſe valiant <hi>Argonautes,</hi> for ſo I may call them, hid themſelves in a little ſhed which they built up in <hi>Nova Zembla,</hi> untill the 14. of <hi>Iune.</hi> For though the voyage of the<note n="r" place="margin">

                     <hi>Argonautes</hi> is made ſo famous by poſteritie, yet if it be compared with this it will ſeeme but a toy; for who hath beene, for the ſpace of 13.

I conceale that which they ſuffered in returning, being compell'd to leave their ſhips and betake themſelves to their boate. I omit to ſpeake of the cruell, fierce, and great Beares, and Sea-Monſters, with which they oftentimes were enforced to fight.

But it ſeemeth, as we may collect out of the <hi>Eclogues</hi> of <hi>Nicolas Zenius,</hi> that it was under the command of the <hi>Norwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> two hundred yeares before, where we reade, that <hi>Zichmus</hi> King of <hi>Friſland</hi> did attempt to get this Iſland by force of Armes, but was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd by the King of <hi>Norwey</hi>'s Garriſon Souldiers, placed in this Iſland. The whole Iſland is divided into foure parts. The Eaſterne part they call <hi>Auſtlendingafiordung,</hi> the Weſterne <hi>Weſtlendingafiordung,</hi> the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne <hi>Nortendingafiordung,</hi> the Southerne <hi>Suydlendingafiordung.</hi> They have no Cities,<note place="margin">The Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</note> but Mountaines in ſtead thereof. Here is a Fountaine, the exhalations whereof will change any thing into ſtone, and yet the ſhape thereof ſhall ſtill remaine. And there is a Fountaine of peſtilent water, which will poyſon any one that taſtes of it. There is water that taſtes like beere. The Northerne <hi>Ocean,</hi> in which this Iſland is ſituate, doth afford ſuch great plenty of fiſh,<note place="margin">The Sea.</note> and is ſo commodious to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of <hi>Iſeland,</hi> that all the Inhabitants doe live and maintaine their Families by it. I ſhould want time to reckon up the ſeverall kindes of Fiſh that are in the Sea, yet it will not be amiſſe, to remember ſome of the rareſt. Among which there is a kind of Fiſh called <hi>Nahual,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of if any one eate, he dieth preſently; and he hath a tooth in the inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt part of his head, which ſtandeth forth 7 cubits in length, which ſome have ſold for an <hi>Vnicornes</hi> horne, and it is beleev'd to have a great vertue againſt poyſon. This Monſter is fortie yards long. The <hi>Royder</hi> is an hundred and thirty Elles long, and hath no teeth; his fleſh is moſt ſweet and pleaſant in eating, and his fat doth heale many diſeaſes. There is the <hi>Brittiſh Whale,</hi> which is thirty Elles long, having no teeth, but a tongue ſeven Elles in length. And there is a kinde of a great <hi>Whale,</hi> which is ſeldome ſeene, being rather like an Iſland it ſelfe than a Fiſh. In regard of the hugeneſſe of his body, hee cannot follow the leſſer fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, yet hee takes them by cunning and craftineſſe. There is alſo an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fiſh called <hi>Stantus Valur,</hi> all griſly, and ſomething like a <hi>Thornback,</hi> but much greater; when he appeareth he ſeemes like an Iſland, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturneth Ships with his Fins. There are alſo Sea-Oxen, called <hi>Seenaut,</hi> of a griſly colour, and divers other fiſhes. I come now to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.<note place="margin">The Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</note> In <hi>Iſeland</hi> (ſaith <hi>Georgius Agricola</hi>) there are three very high Mountaines, whoſe tops are alwayes white with continuall Snow, the bottomes doe burne with continuall Fire.

They which draw neere to this Mountaine to conſider and view more curiouſly the cauſes why it burnes, are ſomtime ſwallowed up alive by ſome hidden breach in the Mountaine, for there are many, and thoſe covered ſo with aſhes, that no man can beware of them: therefore they call this place<note n="t" place="margin">The <hi>Papiſts</hi> thinke, that here is their feined <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie.</hi>

There is an other Mountaine of the ſame nature called <hi>Helga:</hi> this Mountaine in the yeare 1581, (as <hi>Ionas</hi> witneſſeth) did caſt forth fire and ſtones with ſuch a thundering noiſe, that foure ſcore miles from thence, they thought ſome great pieces of Ordnance had beene ſhot off. In one part hereof, ſtrange Spirits are ſeene in the likneſſe of men, ſo that thoſe who doe not know them to bee dead before, would thinke they were alive: nor doe they finde their errour before the ghoſts doe vaniſh away. But theſe things <hi>Ionas</hi> thinkes are fabulous, or elſe the deluſions of the Devill. <hi>Crantzius</hi> and <hi>Olaus</hi> doe write, that the Iſlanders, for the moſt part, doe dwell in Caves, which they digge in the ſides of the Mountaines, eſpecially in the Winter time. But <hi>Ionas,</hi> on the contrary, ſaith, that there are many Temples and houſes built of wood very faire and coſtly. The Iſland hath two Cathedrall Biſhopricks, as <hi>Holar,</hi> or <hi>Hallen,</hi> under which are the Monaſteries <hi>Pingora, Remeſted, Modur, Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keniere;</hi> and <hi>Scalholt,</hi> under which are thoſe Monaſteries <hi>Videy, Pyrne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar, Kirckebar,</hi> and <hi>Shieda.</hi> Yet wee underſtand by the writings of <hi>Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leius</hi> the Authour of this Table, that there are nine Monaſteries in it, and three hundred and nine and twenty Churches.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:23886:77"/>
are infinite numbers of Cattell, which are the Inhabitants chiefe riches, and many flocks of Sheepe, which they ſheare twice a yeare. They have excellent Horſes (called <hi>Hobbies</hi>) which are not pac'd like others, but doe amble very gently. No creeping thing nor Serpent liveth here, nor alſo in <hi>Crete:</hi> and Serpents being often brought hither out of <hi>Brittaine,</hi> as ſoone as they came neere the Land, and ſmell'd the Ayre, they died. <hi>Beda</hi> witneſſeth, that he hath ſeene ſome, who have beene ſtung with Serpents, that have drunk the leaves of Bookes (brought out of <hi>Ireland</hi>) in a Potion, and ſtraight-way the force of the poyſon was allayde, and the ſwelling of the body went downe againe. <hi>Ireland</hi> hath greater ſtore of Faulcons and Hawkes, than other Countries. And here Eagles are as common as Kites in ſome places. Beſides, here is ſo great a number of Cranes, that you ſhall often ſee a hundred in a company together. In the North part alſo there are abundance of Swannes, but there are few Storkes through the whole Iſland, and thoſe black. There are few Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triges and Pheaſants, but no Pies, nor Nightingales. Here is ſuch great ſtore of Bees, that they doe not onely breede in hives, but alſo in hollow trees, and in the cavernes of the earth. <hi>Giraldus</hi> alſo writeth a ſtrange thing concerning a kinde of Birde, commonly called a <hi>Barnacle,</hi> that out of certain pieces of wood, floating up and down in the Sea, there comes out firſt a kinde of Gumme, which afterward growes into a hard ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, within which little Creatures are generated, which firſt have life, and afterward have bils, feathers and wings, with which they doe flye in the Ayre, or ſwim in the water, and in this manner and no other this Creature is generated. This <hi>Giraldus</hi> doth teſtifie, that hee hath ſeene ſome of them halfe formed, which as ſoone as they came to perfection did flie as well as the reſt. There are alſo many birds of a twofold ſhape, (as he witneſſeth) which they call <hi>Aurifriſij,</hi> leſſer than an Eagle, and bigger than a Hawke; whom Nature, to delight her ſelfe, hath framed with one foote armed with tallents ſharpe and open, the other ſmoothe with a plaine webbe. There are other Birdes which they call <hi>Marineta,</hi> leſſe than a Blackbird, being ſhort like a Starling, yet differing from him by the whiteneſſe of the belly, and the blackneſſe of the back. It is a wonderfull thing which was reported concerning theſe Birdes, for if when they are dead they be kept in a dry place, they will not putrifie or corrupt: and being placed among garments and other things, it will preſerve them from moathes. That which is more worthy of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that, if being dead, they be hanged up in ſome drie place, they will every yeare renew and change their feathers, as if they were alive <hi>Ireland</hi> contayneth all kindes of wilde beaſts. It hath Harts that are ſo fat, that they can hardly runne; and by how much they are leſſer in body, by ſo much the larger are their hornes. There are great ſtore of Bores, many Hares, &amp;c. but the bodies of all the wilde beaſts and birds are leſſer here than in other places. It hath many Badgers, and Weeſils. It hath few or no Goates, fallow Deere, Hedghogs, Moles; but infinite ſtore of Mice. It hath alſo Wolves and Foxes. But enough of theſe things, I returne to other matters.

For after <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of <hi>Pembroke</hi> conquered and tooke it, it alwaies continued in peacable quietneſſe and obedience to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> endeavouring to bring <hi>Ireland</hi> into ſubjection; whence the Kings of <hi>England</hi> did grant them many and divers immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and freedomes, which <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh did encreaſe and confirme, becauſe the Cittizens did behave themſelves valiantly and wiſely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Perkin VVarbeck,</hi> who with the wings of impudence thought to aſpire to the royall Throne. This Citie was built by Pyrats of <hi>Norway,</hi> which although it have a thick aire, a ſoile not very pleaſant, and very narrow ſtreets, yet ſuch is the conveniencie of the Haven, that it is the ſecond Ctity in <hi>Ireland</hi> for wealth &amp; populouſnes, &amp; is filled with many wiſe &amp; well behaved Citizens. It hath a ſafe &amp; quiet Haven, &amp; which is often full of outlandiſh &amp; forraine ſhips. For there are many Merchants in <hi>Waterford,</hi> who in trading do ſo wiſely uſe their ſtock, &amp; ſo warily caſt up their accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that in a ſhort time they get great ſtore of wealth; they are not for the moſt part indebted, but have ready money. There are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few uſurers, which by fraudulent &amp; intolerable intereſt live upon the goods &amp; ſpoile of the Cittizens by taking them to pawne. The Citizens are curteous, bountifull, thriftie, hoſpitable to ſtrangers, and ſerviceable both in private and publique affaires. This Citie was anciently called <hi>Menapia,</hi> as <hi>Dublin Eblana:</hi> or rather <hi>Amellana</hi> from <hi>Amellanus,</hi> who built it, as it is reported that <hi>Sitaracus</hi> built <hi>Waterford,</hi> and <hi>Ivorus Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick;</hi> They being Coſen-Germans, and heretofore of great authoritie in <hi>Ireland.</hi> There is alſo in this Countrie <hi>Limrick,</hi> which is the third Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that excells the reſt, for commodious ſituation, and for the faireneſſe of the River, being watered with <hi>Shennin</hi> the chiefe of all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;

though this Citie bee diſtant from the Sea ſixtie miles, yet the ſhip-maſters doe bring ſhippes of great burthen even to the walls of the Citie, neither neede they feare any rockes all the way they come up. It is wonderfull to ſee what ſtore and plentie of fiſh you ſhall finde there. <hi>Iohn</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> being enamoured with the pleaſantneſſe of this Cittie, built there a faire Caſtle, and a Bridge. There is alſo <hi>Corcagia</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Corke,</hi> which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> call <hi>Cork,</hi> and the natives <hi>Korkcach,</hi> environed with a wall, not very wide in compaſſe. It is ſtretched out ſo as to make but one ſtreet, yet there is a prettie and very faire market place; it hath an excellent ſafe harbour, but hath heretofore beene ſo encompaſſed with ſeditious neighbours, that they keepe continuall watch and ward, as if they were alwaies beſieged, and they ſcarce marrie their daughters into the countrie, by reaſon whereof, marrying among themſelves, all the Citizens are ſomewhat allied one to another. The Citizens are ſtrong in Souldiers, they addict themſelves to merchandiſe, and governe their affaires both at home and abroad very frugally. <hi>Coenalis</hi> writeth, that the holy man <hi>Briacus</hi> came from hence, from whom the Dioceſſe of <hi>Sanbrioch</hi> in <hi>Brittaine,</hi> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called S. <hi>Brieu,</hi> tooke its name.

the Kings and the Kings Sonnes lawfully begotten have the firſt place, of which if there bee many, the eldeſt Sonne is called Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the reſt are onely called Princes, but when the King is publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crowned, hee promiſeth to all the people, that he will keepe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Lawes, Rites, and Cuſtomes of his Anceſtours, and uſe them in the ſame manner as they did. The Dukes have the ſecond place, the Earles the third, and thoſe Nobles the fourth place, who are not known by that Title in forraine Countries, but the <hi>Scots</hi> doe call them <hi>My Lords.</hi> This name is ſo much eſteem'd amongſt them, that for honours ſake they attribute it to their Biſhops, Earles, and chiefeſt Magiſtrates. In the fifth place are the Knights and Barons, who are uſually called Lords. They are in the ſixth and laſt place, who having attained to no title of honour, but yet deſcended from a noble Familie, are therefore commonly called Gentlemen; as the Brothers, and Sonnes of Earles and Lords, the youngeſt Sonnes of Knights, who have no part in the Inheritance, becauſe (by the Lawes of <hi>Scotland</hi>) that commeth unto the eldeſt Sonne, for the preſervation of the Familie, but the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple call all thoſe Gentlemen, who are either rich or well ſpoken of for their hoſpitality. The whole weight of warre doth depend on the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the loweſt degree. The Plebeians or Citizens are partly chiefe men, who beare office in their Cities, partly Merchants, and partly Tradeſmen, or Handy-craftes-men, all which becauſe they are free from Tribute and other burdens, doe eaſily grow rich. And leaſt any thing ſhould be too heavily enacted againſt any Citie, the King permits that in publick aſſemblies or Parliaments three or foure Citizens, being called out of every Citie, ſhould freely interpoſe their opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning matters propounded. Heretofore the Clergie was governed by the authoritie of Decrees &amp; Councels, but now (as the reſt) they are ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Lawes, which the Kings have deviſed, or confirmed by their royall aſſent. The Booke which containeth the <hi>municipall</hi> Lawes, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Latine, is entituled <hi>Regia Majeſtas,</hi> the Kings Majeſtie, becauſe the Booke begins with thoſe words: In the other Bookes of the Lawes, the Acts of their Councels (which are called Parliaments) are written in <hi>Scotch.</hi> There are many and divers Magiſtrates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as in other Nations. Among theſe, the chiefe and next to the King is the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of the Kingdome (whom they call the Governour.) Hee hath the charge of governing the Kingdome, if the Common-wealth at any time be deprived of her King; or the King by reaſon of his tender age cannot manage the affaires of the Kingdome. There is alſo a continuall Senate at <hi>Edenburrough,</hi> ſo framed of the Clergie and Nobilitie, that the Clergie doth in number equall the Laiety. The Clergie have a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent over them, who hath the firſt place in delivering his opinion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Chancellour of the Kingdome bee preſent, for hee hath the chiefe place in all affaires of the Kingdome.

There are alſo in ſeverall Provinces, which they call Viecounties, thoſe which are Governours of them, whom by an ancient name they
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:23886:98"/>
call Vicounts. Their authority in deciding thoſe matters which belong to civill cauſes, doth depend on a certaine hereditary right, by which they claime alſo unto themſelves thoſe Vicountſhips. So that theſe Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts may be ſaid not to be created by the King, but borne unto it by right from their Parents. The Cities alſo and Townes have their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, their Bailiffes, and other Magiſtrates of that kinde, who keepe the Citizens in obedience, and doe maintaine and defend the Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Cities, whereby it comes to paſſe that the Common-wealth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the apt diſpoſition and ranking of Degrees, by the holy Majeſtie of Lawes and the authority of Magiſtrates, doth flouriſh, and deſerveth great praiſe.

In this Country about ten miles from the Towne <hi>Ayr,</hi> there is a ſtone al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt twelve foot high, and thirty Cubits thicke, which is called the deafe ſtone, for if you hollow or ſhoot off a Musket on the one ſide, hee that ſtandeth on the other ſide next to the ſtone cannot heare it, he that ſtands farther off ſhall heare it better, and he that ſtands fartheſt off ſhall heare it beſt.

On the left ſide of <hi>Carron</hi> there are two little hills built by the induſtrie of men, which are commonly called <hi>Duni pacis.</hi> On the right ſide of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> there is a plaine field that at laſt riſeth into a little hill, being in the middle betweene <hi>Duni pacis,</hi> and a little Chappell. On the ſide of this hill there appeareth yet the ruines or remainder of a ſmall Citie. But the foundation of the Walls, and the deſcription of the ſtreetes, partly by tillage, and partly by digging forth ſquared ſtones for the building of rich mens houſes, cannot be diſtinctly knowne. This place <hi>Beda</hi> doth call <hi>Guidi,</hi> and doth place it in a corner of the trench made by <hi>Severus</hi> the Emperour. Many famous <hi>Roman</hi> Writers have made mention of this Trench and Bulwarke.

The temporall Courts are two-fold, namely of Law, and of equity. The Courts of Law are the Kings Bench, the Starre-Chamber, the Common Pleas, the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, the Court of Wards and Liveries, the Court of the Admiraltie and Aſſiſes; wee omit others which are obſcure. The Kings Bench is ſo called, becauſe the King is wont to ſit in it, and it handleth Pleas of the Crowne. The Starre-Chamber, or rather the Court of the Kings Counſell is that, in which criminall matters are handled, as perjuries, impoſtures, deceits, and the like. The Common Pleas is ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe common pleas are tried there betweene the Subjects, by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> which they call the Common Law. The Exchequer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riveth its name from a foure ſquare Table, covered with a Chequer-Cloth, at which the Barons ſit; in it all cauſes are heard, which belong to the Exchequer. The Court of Wards hath his name from Wards, whoſe cauſes it handleth. The Admirals Court handleth Sea-matters Thoſe which wee call the Aſſiſes, are held twice in a yeare in moſt Shires; in which two Judges of Aſſiſe appointed for it, with the Juſtices of peace doe enquire and determine of civill and criminall matters. The Courts of Equity are the <hi>Chancerie,</hi> the Court of Requeſts, and the Councell in the Marſhes of Wales. The Chancerie draweth its name from the Chancellour, who ſitteth there. This Court gives judgement according to equitie, and the extreame rigour of the Law is thereby

tempered. The Court of Requeſts heareth the cauſes of the poore, and of the Kings Servants. The chiefe ſpirituall Courts are the Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Clergie, the Courts which belong to the Archbiſhop him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and the Chancellours Courts, kept in every Dioceſſe.

All <hi>Denmarke</hi> is a <hi>Peninſula,</hi> as the Deſcription ſheweth, and is divided into 184 Prefectſhips or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, which they call <hi>Harret,</hi> and they are governed by ſo many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects skilfull in the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Lawes. It hath a King rather by election of the Nobles, than by ſucceſſion of birth: the ancient manner of chuſing him was, that when they gave their voyce, they ſtood in the open field upon ſtones, devoting by the firme ſtabilitie of the ſtones under them, the conſtancy of their election. The Kings are crowned at <hi>Hafnia</hi> in the Church of the bleſſed Virgine <hi>Mary</hi> before the Altar, and are led into the aforeſaid Church by the Senatours of the Kingdome, the enſignes of regality being carried before them, as the Sword, Globe, and Crown. Neither are theſe things attributed to ſpeciall Families, as it is in moſt Countries, but as every one excelleth in vertue and dignitie, ſo is hee choſen to that place. Firſt the King is compelled to ſweare that he will obſerve certaine written Articles, and that hee will ſtrictly defend the Chriſtian Religion, and the Lawes and Cuſtomes of the Kingdome. Afterward hee is anoynted by the Biſhop of <hi>Roeſchild,</hi> and firſt the Crowne is ſet upon his head by all the Senatours, who then take their oath to his Majeſtie, if they have not done it before the Coronation, and then the King maketh out of the Gentry ſome Knights by the light ſtroke of a ſword, for ſome ſervice done either in peace or warre. Thus the ancient <hi>Danes</hi> did eſtabliſh an excellent Politicall State and Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie, neither hath any Nation ever brought them into ſubjection, or tooke away their Country Rites and Priviledges. But on the contrary the Northerne people, as the <hi>Danes, Swedens, Norwegians,</hi> have waſted almoſt <hi>Europe,</hi> and in ſome places have eſtabliſhed Kingdomes.

All the Caſtles, lands, and goods, as well moveable as immoveable, left them by their parents, are equally divided among the brethren: and the ſiſters by a ſpeciall priviledge have a ſhare alſo, yet ſo, that the brother hath two parts with the Caſtles and places of ſtrength, and the ſiſter but one. By this meanes the eldeſt ſonnes have not much lands, yet ſome of them comming of a good Familie, and being endued with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, through the Kings favour, doe advance themſelves to great poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by marriage. Out of this order the Senatours of the Kingdome are choſen, who are ſeldome more then 28. Theſe Senatours have a certain allowance from the King and Kingdome, for they have Caſtles ſo long as they bee Senatours, for which they pay no rent to the King, but are charged to keepe certaine horſes both in peace and warre, and whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the King calls them, they are to be ready at the proper charge of the Kingdome. If they be ſent on any Embaſſage out of the Kingdome, they have allowance out of the Exchequer, that they may performe their journey in a Princely manner, as becommeth a Kings Embaſſadours. The other Nobles alſo have ſufficient maintenance from the King, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they live at Court or not. For the King hath lands which in the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> ſpeech are called <hi>Verleghninge</hi> or Benefices, and out of theſe hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth maintenance, either for terme of life, or for yeares, to thoſe who have done him or the Kingdome any ſervice. And thoſe who hold theſe Benefices of the King, are charged to keepe certaine horſes, and to pay yearely a certaine ſumme of money into the Exchequer, yet ſo as they may gaine ſomething in reward of their labour and ſervice. There is alſo a good Law &amp; Inſtitution in the Kingdome of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> whereby the King is prohibited and reſtrained from buying any immoveable goods of the Nobles, leaſt any diſſention ſhould ariſe betweene the King and them. For otherwiſe the King might by violence take into his hands thoſe lands which the Nobles would not ſell: yet the King may change any immoveable goods with the Nobles, though on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Nobles cannot buy any of them of the Kings Farmers, many of which have hereditarie, and (as it were) free lands.</p>

Next to him is the Marſhall, which in the time of warre and peace doth provide thoſe things which appertaine to expedition. In the third place is the Admirall, which doth build new ſhips, repaire the old, and every year order the ſea-matters, for the ſecuring of the coaſts. He hath under him an other Admirall appointed, and in every ſhip a Captaine, who muſt bee borne a Gentleman. There is alſo the Chancellour of the Kingdome, to whom out of all the Provinces and Iſles they appeale and make ſuite unto, and from whom appeale is alſo made to the King and the Senate of the Kingdome. All the Provinces are divided into <hi>Haeret,</hi> as they call them, or into Dioceſes, under which are many Pariſhes, heere, if there be any controverſies, matters are firſt tried. And from hence they appeale to the Judge of the <hi>Haeret.</hi> Afterward to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour, and laſt of all to the King and Senatours, where it hath a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and finall Judgement. They have a written Law, compoſed by <hi>Woldemare</hi> the firſt, together with the Biſhops and Senators, which is very agreeable to the law of Nature, and not much differing from the <hi>Roman</hi> Lawes, and that cauſes and ſuites may ſooner have an end, and judgement be given and put in execution, It is provided that Judges, if they doe any wrong or give falſe judgement, are condemned to loſe halfe their goods; whereof the King hath the one part, and the injured partie the other. <hi>Woldemare</hi> the firſt (except I be deceiv'd) added the Biſhops to the Senators, whom <hi>Chriſtianus</hi> the third, for rebellion and certaine other cauſes did put out againe. The Kings Chancellour, who for the moſt part followeth the King in the Court, hath ſeven or eight Noble men adjoyned unto him as Aſſiſtants, beſides Secretaries and Clerkes; and all buſineſſes are diſpatch'd by the King himſelfe. But if it be ſome matter of conſequence, as concerning peace or warre, entring into league with forraine Nations, or into conſultation concerning the defending of their owne Territories, then the King calleth a Councell of Senators. Neither can the King impoſe any taxe upon the Kingdome or Countrie, without their conſent, and the conſent of the Nobles. There is alſo in this Kingdome a Maſter of the Exchequer, who colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:23886:138"/>
and gathereth all the Revenues of the whole Kingdome, both of Caſtles, Farmes, and Cuſtomes, as well by Sea as by Land. Hee taketh account of them, enquireth into them, and giveth acquittances for the receit of them. Hee hath two Aſſiſtants of the Nobilitie, and many Clerkes under him; and for his office hath a yearely ſtipend or penſion.</p>
                     <p>The third State is of the Clergie, in which there are ſeven Biſhops, as the Biſhop of <hi>Lunden,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Roeſchild,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Otthon,</hi> of <hi>Rip,</hi> of <hi>Wiburg,</hi> of <hi>Arhuſe,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Sleſwich,</hi> to whom the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Canonicall perſons have relation. Theſe have the Tenths of the Kingdome; which in divers Countries are divided in a divers manner for the Biſhops have an halfe part of the Tenths, and the King an halfe part, the Canoniſts and Preachers have a part, and a part is contributed toward the building and repairing of Churches. And as concerning the Popes authoritie in this Kingdome, as alſo in <hi>France,</hi> the ordination of Prelates and Biſhops have beene alwayes in the Kings power, as may appeare by the anſwer of <hi>Woldemare</hi> the firſt, King of <hi>Denmarke,</hi> which heere I have annexed. When the Pope required theſe and the like pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges from the King, it is reported, that the King writ back unto him, <hi>Wee have our Kingdome from our Subjects, our life from our Parents, our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from the Romiſh Church, which if you will take from us, I ſend it you by theſe preſents.</hi> And as the wiſe Decree of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth is praiſed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting Eccleſiaſticall perſons from buying any immoveable thing without the conſent of the King, ſo <hi>Christian</hi> the third as wiſely did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, that the Clergie ſhould not ſell any thing without the Kings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe commandement. In other matters the Clergie-men through the whole kingdome are well provided for by <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the third, of famous memorie, and many Schooles erected in many places, as alſo two in <hi>Iſeland,</hi> where they have likewiſe a Printing-Houſe. There is but one Univerſitie in the whole kingdome, called the Univerſitie of<note n="h" place="margin">This Citie is called by the <hi>Germans Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhagen,</hi> that is, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants Haven.</note>

                        </hi> or <hi>Hafnia,</hi> founded by <hi>Chriſterne</hi> the firſt, by permiſſion of Pope <hi>Sixt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The fourth State is of the Citizens and Merchants, dwelling in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Townes. Theſe have proper and peculiar priviledges which they enjoy, beſides certaine fields and woods that belong to them; and theſe doe traffique both by Sea and Land in all parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> Out of theſe, as alſo out of the Countrey-people, the Biſhops, the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, the Preachers, and Senators of Cities, the Clerkes of Bands, the Lievtenants of Towres, and the Maſters of Ships are choſen, and ſome of them are Maſters of the Cuſtomes or Tributes; laſtly, of theſe all leſſer Councels of Juſtice doe conſiſt, one of the Nobility, for the moſt part, ſitting as Preſident.</p>
                     <p>The fifth State is of the Ruſtick, or Countrey-people, and there are two ſorts of them, the firſt they call <hi>Freibunden,</hi> that is, Free-holders. Theſe doe hold Lands of Inheritance, yet paying for the ſame ſome little free-rent every yeare. Theſe doe alſo uſe merchandiſe and fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They are not oppreſt with doing ſervices, neither doe they pay any taxes, unleſſe the Senators of the kingdome doe grant it as a ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:23886:138"/>
The other ſort is of thoſe, who doe not poſſeſſe goods of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but doe farme them of the King, the Nobles or Eccleſiaſticall perſons, and are conſtrained to doe many ſervices for their Lords, in ſuch manner, as they ſhall covenant with their Land-lord. Theſe are the chiefe things which I thought good to declare concerning the <hi>State politick of Denmarke;</hi> whereby it appeareth, that the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Monarchie was, for the moſt part, well framed: for the free election of the Kings being in the hands of the Nobilitie, and yet notwithſtanding out of the royall Progenie, as wee ſaid before: it followeth, that the <hi>Danes</hi> have no civill warres or diſſentions, unleſſe thoſe which are betweene ſuch as bee of the Blood Royall, which are quickly compoſed by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and helpe of the Nobles; but eſpecially ſeeing the Kings younger Sonnes can have no part of the kingdome. Moreover, as they are all ſtiled but Nobles, and know not the titles and names of Barons, Earles, and Dukes, ſo there are none that have ſo much wealth and power, as that repoſing truſt therein, they dare oppoſe themſelves againſt the Royall Familie; becauſe the Fathers Inheritance is alwayes divided betweene the Sonnes and Daughters. Thus the Kings of <hi>Denmarke</hi> have a flouriſhing Common-wealth, which may eaſily bee defended from forraine enemies, whom their Subjects, living in unanimity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with them as their naturall Lords, are able to reſiſt both by ſea and land.</p>

Of theſe things therefore I will ſpeake briefly, and thus it was. When the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> did rule all <hi>Spaine,</hi> and had all things under their owne command, the Senate and people of <hi>Rome</hi> did ſend firſt of all the two <hi>Scipioes</hi> againſt them with an army of Souldiers, in the beginning of the ſecond <hi>Punick</hi> warre: who were ſlaine in the ſeventh yeare of that war, <hi>Q. Fulvius Flaccus</hi> and <hi>Ap. Claudius Pulcher</hi> being Conſuls. The next year <hi>P. Cornelius Scipio Africanus</hi> being ſent next to his Father &amp; Uncle, did performe many things very proſperouſly, and firſt of all made a Province of it, <hi>Q. Caecilius Metellus,</hi> and <hi>L. Veturius Philo</hi> being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls. Firſt, <hi>Aſdrubal</hi> and <hi>Mago Carthaginian</hi> Captaines, being overthrown and put to flight in the battell, neere to the Citie <hi>Baetula</hi> (which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been in that place where now <hi>Baëca</hi> and <hi>Vbeda</hi> are ſeated) and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Armies beaten out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> hee eſtabliſhed a league of friendſhip with <hi>Syphax</hi> King of the <hi>Maſsilians,</hi> who is now called <hi>Bile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgerid;</hi> a litle after hee compelled the rebellious people of <hi>Spaine</hi> to yeeld themſelves unto him, and having made a league with <hi>Maſſaniſſa</hi> King of the <hi>Maſaeſulians,</hi> and the <hi>Gaditanes,</hi> hee committed the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Province to <hi>L. Lentulus</hi> and <hi>L. Manlius Acidinus,</hi> and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Rome.</hi> After <hi>Scipio, L. Cornelius Lentulus</hi> the Proconſul did go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne <hi>Spaine,</hi> and after many proſperous acts and atchievements, entred the Citie in triumph. Three yeares after, <hi>C. Cornelius, Cethegus,</hi> and <hi>Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Rufus</hi> being Conſuls, the two <hi>Spaines</hi> were firſt bounded, and two new Pretors ſent into them, <hi>C. Sempronius Tuditanus</hi> into the hither <hi>Spaine,</hi> and <hi>M. Helvetius Blaſio</hi> into the farther. Two yeares being ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſt, ſo great a warre began in <hi>Spaine,</hi> that it was neceſſarie, that a Conſul ſhould be ſent out with an Army: <hi>Marcus Portius Cato</hi> Conſul being allotted to goe into the hither part, did ſo appeaſe and quiet rebellion, that the Proconſul in regard thereof triumphed. This is that <hi>Cato,</hi> who, as <hi>Livie</hi> writeth and others, by a wonderfull ſtratagem, did throw downe the wals of many <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cities in one day. After <hi>Cato</hi>'s victorie, <hi>Spaine</hi> was diverſly poſſeſſed, and many times loſt and regained againe, ſo that there were above 30 triumphs for victories obtained heere. They did not begin to pay any taxe, before the time of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> who having by long continuance of warres tamed all <hi>Spaine,</hi> and overthrowne the <hi>Cantabrians</hi> and <hi>Aſturians</hi> that had longeſt of all made reſiſtance, divided the whole Countrie into three Provinces, <hi>Baetica,</hi> ſo called from the River <hi>Baetis, Luſitania,</hi> and <hi>Tarraconenſis,</hi> ſo called from its citie <hi>Tarracon;</hi> and every one of theſe have their Dioceſſes or Circles of juriſdiction.

For firſt, <hi>Spaine</hi> is thy Mother, a Land more happie than all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, (the great Fabricator and Maker of all things hath beene more favourable, in enriching and adorning this Countrie, than the Countries of others Nations) for it is neither obnoxious to the Summers heate, nor ſubject to the Northerne cold, but is ſeated in the temperate Climate, and by the witty diligence of Nature, it is, as it were, an other world, as being encloſed on one ſide with the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renaean</hi> Mountaines, heere with the Ocean, and there with the ſhores of the <hi>Tyrrhenian</hi> Sea. Beſides, adde to this the many famous Cities which are therein, the whole Countries being either tilled, or full of fruites and flocks, the gold-bearing Rivers that water it, and the ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling pretious ſtones that enrich it; I know that Poets in their Fables which they have invented to pleaſe the eare, have attributed miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous things to ſome Nations, which whether they are true or not, yet are very ſtrange: neither doe I now ſeeke out the truth: Let <hi>Gargara</hi> (as it is written) yeeld a great increaſe of corne: let <hi>Menavia</hi> be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for her flocks, <hi>Campania</hi> for the Mountaine <hi>Gaurano, Lydia</hi> for the River <hi>Pactolus, Spaine</hi> hath every thing that is praiſe-worthy.

That are three heads eſpecially to be conſidered in the adminiſtration of Kingdomes, Principalities, and Provinces, namely the Eccleſiaſticall State, the Political State, and the Adminiſtration of Iuſtice: firſt therefore according to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the whole government is in the hands of the Nobilitie) I will in the firſt place reckon thoſe who are Feudals to the Prince, and afterward thoſe that are free, deſcending ſtill in order from the higheſt degree of Nobilitie, as Dukes, Earles, Barons, and Lords. Thirdly, I will ſhew into what Prefectures the Countrie is divided: and I ſuppoſe that by theſe three things the Politicall State will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:23886:212"/>
declared. In the adminiſtration of Iuſtice, the juridicall Dioceſſes ſhall be noted, and the higher Senates to which appeale may be made. Laſtly, in the Eccleſiaſticall State, the Archbiſhops, if there be any, ſhall bee placed firſt, and then the ſuffragan Biſhops which are under them, as alſo thoſe which are ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans to others. To reckon up all theſe things requires much ſtudie, but ſeeing for want of matter it may be briefly delivered, I will performe what I may, that ſo I may ſtirre up lovers of their countrie to emulate a greater perfection in their writings. The ſeverall places ſhall be noted with numbers, that they may be ſtraight-way found out in the following Table; the firſt number ſhall containe the degrees and minutes of Longitude, which ſhall be ſought out in the Northerne or Southerne ſide of the Table, the later ſhall have the numbers of Latitude, which are to be ſought on the Weſterne or Eaſterne ſide. From theſe bounds, heere by the direction of the Meridian, and there of the Parallel of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, you ſhall come at laſt to their interſection, and ſo finde out the place propounded. The ſituation of thoſe places which are in the deſcription of the generall Tables ought to be ſought from thence. But if ſo be that ſome names are not found in the table following, it was the fault of the Chorographer who delineated it, for the right deſigning and placing of principalities and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is not to be omitted. The rule and government of Countries is in the power of the Nobilitie, and therefore it is both profitable and delightfull to know and diſtinguiſh their ſeverall degrees, and the proper conditions of them. The higheſt degree is that of Emperour or King, whom in order doe follow the degrees of Duke, Earle, Baron, the militarie Tribune, whom the <hi>Low-country-men</hi> call <hi>Banderheer, quaſi Bendae,</hi> that is, Lord of the Troupes, which he leadeth under his Banner. After him is the Knight, or hee that hath attained to be of the Horſemans Order, whom the <hi>French-men</hi> doe call <hi>Chevalier,</hi> and the <hi>Low-country-men Ridder.</hi> In the laſt place is <hi>vn Eſcuyer,</hi> who beareth Armes, but hath attained to no publick dignitie. There are three degrees of Earles, the firſt whereof the <hi>French-men</hi> call <hi>Viconte,</hi> who excelleth the reſt in dignity &amp; priviledges, <hi>Ludovic. Guic.</hi> would have him now called a <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave.</hi> And though this Order of Earles in time hath remitted ſomething of its honour, yet in the beginning it was of more excellent dignitie, as the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof ſhall by and by declare. In the ſecond degree is the Earle Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, who is called in <hi>Dutch, Landgrave.</hi> In the third degree is the Marqueſſe, or Marckgrave. Theſe are the ſpeciall degrees and orders of Nobilitie, among which the government of every Countrie is divided. There are alſo ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in theſe degrees which might occaſion a ſubdiviſion, but ſuch as are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht rather by priviledges than by forme of government. Yet moreover I will deliver the lawfull differences and conditions of every order which I have mentioned, as I have found them in a certaine <hi>French</hi> Booke, entituled <hi>La di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion du monde:</hi> deducing their creation from the loweſt degree of Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whence their proprieties and order of government doe moſt clearely appeare.

If hee, having long fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the warres, exerciſed armes, beene preſent at many conflicts, hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient meanes to maintaine the ſtate of his degree, and commeth of a great, noble, and rich Familie; then in any skirmiſh hee ſhall make knowne his requeſt to the Generall of the Army, or to ſome valiant generous Knight, and when the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell is ended, hee ſhall come unto the ſaid Generall or Knight, and entreate him

atchievements. Adde to this that which <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> witneſſeth, namely, that Dukes and Earles were in the beginning made Prefects by the King over Nations and Cities on this condition, onely that as often as there was occaſion they ſhould bee diſmiſſed or changed. Now how could the afore ſaid Lawes of creating Princes (which are meaſured by, and doe claime the hereditarie poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Lands) be in force at that time, ſeeing Dukedomes and Counties were conferr'd by Kings and Emperours as a temporary bountie? Therefore though the preciſe time of the Inſtitution of them cannot be ſhewed (for that <hi>French</hi> Booke doth mention nothing of it) yet it is very likely, that under <hi>Otto</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Emperour, or about the yeare one thouſand, or a litle after, that manner of conſtituting and confirming dignities was ordained by the Monarches. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven untill <hi>Otto</hi> the ſecond, every Prince according to his power and ambition, did aſpire to greater dignitie and royall Majeſtie. So out of one Kingdome of <hi>Lotharingia</hi> or <hi>Lorreine,</hi> which being extended from the <hi>Rhene</hi> even to the River <hi>Scaldis,</hi> was bounded with the <hi>Frieſland</hi> Sea, and belonged to <hi>Lothari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Lodovicus Pius,</hi> more Kingdomes did afterward ariſe, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>transjurane Burgundie,</hi> which being extended from the Mountaine <hi>Jura</hi> even to the <hi>Alpes,</hi> did containe all <hi>Helvetia,</hi> the <hi>Rauraci,</hi> the <hi>Allobro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> and the <hi>transjurane Burgundians:</hi> and the Kingdome of <hi>Provence</hi> which did containe ſome part of <hi>Burgundie</hi> and <hi>Sabaudia,</hi> and was afterward called the Kingdome of <hi>Arelatum,</hi> of which at this day the Elector of <hi>Trevers</hi> is called the Archchancellour. It did alſo containe the Kingdome of <hi>Lotharin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi> now alſo called <hi>Lotharingia,</hi> and other Kingdomes betweene the <hi>Rhene</hi> and <hi>Scaldis,</hi> even to the <hi>Frieſland</hi> Sea; and heretofore it was called the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of<note n="a" place="margin">It was called <hi>Auſtraſia,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from one <hi>Auſtraſius</hi> a Preſident, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

I omit the other Kingdomes which ſprung up in that age by the deſire and affectation of Soveraignty. But the Emperour <hi>Otto</hi> the ſecond did divide <hi>Lotharingia,</hi> having tooke away the name of a Kingdome, into nine Dukedomes and Earledomes, as it were, into members pull'd and ſeparated from the body, as <hi>Cuſpinian</hi> hath it, and having made a diviſion thereof <hi>Anno 981,</hi> he firſt made <hi>Charles</hi> the Brother of <hi>Lotharius</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> Duke of that Countrie which is now called <hi>Lotharingia,</hi> as <hi>Richardus Wiſſenburgius</hi> doth ſpeake more at large. It ſeemeth that after that time the arbitrarie erection and raiſing of Kingdomes and Principalities did faile, the Monarches now contriving how to eſtabliſh a ſetled Empire, which conſiſteth in the juſt proportion and harmonie of its parts, as in man the parts of the body to the head. Therefore that ſome order might be perpetually kept in Principality and in government; I ſuppoſe that at length about the ſame time which I mentioned before, theſe afore-ſaid Lawes were deviſed.

The ſame <hi>Caeſar</hi> noteth, that the <hi>French-men,</hi> when any matter of note happeneth, are wont by a ſpeedie way, to notifie it unto the Countries round about, and that is by acclamations and ſhouting with the voyce, for from them the others receive it, and they againe by the ſame meanes make it knowne to their neighbours. They doe not ſuffer their Children (ſaith <hi>Caeſar</hi>) when they are growne to ripeneſſe of yeares, to come unto them openly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhould not neglect the ſervice of the warres: and they thinke it an unſeemely thing for the Sonne in his Childehood to ſit in publick in the ſight of his Father.

The <hi>French</hi> women are beautifull, and like men for ſtrength and ſtature, as <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſaith; they are fruitfull, and when they bring forth children, they give them good education.

After him the ſworne men as they call them ſhould ſucceede: Who being fifty at the beginning were reduced to 24. and in the yeare 1378. they were contracted to 12. according to the number of the parts of the Citie.

Byrſa</hi> floweth out of the Mountaine <hi>Iura</hi> thorow ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Valleyes even to <hi>Baſilea,</hi> carrying downe with it many Boat-loads of Wood. On the other ſide the River <hi>Wieſa</hi> doth part it from the Black wood, and much Timber for Building is brought downe this River, and afterward it filleth many Ciſternes, and ſerveth many Houſes in the leſſer <hi>Baſil</hi> with water.

But of this enough. It remaineth that wee ſhould adde ſomething concerning the government of the Common-wealth in theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.

The greater when many meete together in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Commons, and this for the moſt part is called when there are ſome ſerious waighty affaires, which appertaine to the Common-wealth. The leſſe is that which looketh daily to the government of the Common-wealth, and determines matters of controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Citizens.

For 12. are elected out of every Tribe to make up the greater Counſell, beſides at <hi>Tigurum</hi> there are 18. choſen out of the Nobles. To the leſſer Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>Tiguri</hi> the ſeverall Tribes doe ſend three men, at <hi>Baſil</hi> foure men, and to theſe are added two Counſels in every City, who are the chiefe Heads of the City; and moreover at <hi>Baſil</hi> there are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tribunes, whom they call the Heads of the Counſell in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they doe the Conſuls: beſides at <hi>Tigurum</hi> there are 6. choſen out of the Nobility to make up the leſſer Counſell, when there are but 3. choſen out of the other Tribes, and moreover 6. others are choſen by free Suffrages, out of any Tribe which the Magiſtrate ſhall thinke fitt. The leſſer Counſell is devided into the old and the new: they call thoſe the old Senate who have borne office halfe a yeere: the other although they are called when the Senate is held, yet they are not alwaies called, and there are ſome matters which the new Senate doth onely diſpatch. The greater Counſell alſo at <hi>Baſil</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in the ſame manner, and of 12. men choſen out of the Tribes, 6. are joyned or added to the new Senate, and ſo many to the old. The leſſer Counſell doth meete for the moſt part thrice, and ſometimes 4. times every weeke. There is one Conſull belonging to the Senates, whom in their ſpeech they call <hi>Burgermeiſter,</hi> that is, the Maſter of the Citizens, and the greater Counſell doth chooſe him.

Long ſince the Low Countrimen were accounted brave ſouldiers. And <hi>Caeſar Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Commentaries,</hi> concerning the <hi>French</hi> warre, doth call them the valianteſt of all the <hi>Gaulls.</hi> For he writeth thus. The valianteſt of all the <hi>Gauls</hi> are the Low Countriemen, becauſe they care not for trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of attire, and merchants have not frequent recourſe unto them, and therefore thoſe commodities are not brought to them which doe effeminate the minde; and they are neere to the <hi>Germaines,</hi> who live beyond the <hi>Rhene,</hi> with whom they wage continuall warre; by which reaſon alſo the <hi>Helvetians</hi> doe exceede the other <hi>French-men</hi> for valour, becauſe they have dayly skirmiſhes and fights with the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,</hi> when either they drive them forth out of their borders, or they doe make inroades into their Territories. And hence wee may collect their ſtrength and courage in defending their liberties, that in the time of <hi>C. Caeſar,</hi> they endeavoured to ſhake off the <hi>Romaine</hi> yoke of ſubjection. And ſo they muſtred &amp; joyned armies to contend with them. The <hi>Bellovacians</hi> ſet forth 6000 ſouldiers, the <hi>Sueſſones</hi> 5000, &amp; the <hi>Nervians</hi> (who were then ſo wilde and uncivill, that they would not ſuffer Merchants at that time to bring them wine or other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities) did ſet forth 5000.

40 thouſand. So that the whole ſumme of choyſe Souldiers was 273 thouſand, as <hi>Oroſius</hi> witneſſeth: or as <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelfe delivers, their number was 368 thouſand, whereby it appeareth that the Low Countrie men were alwayes noble Souldiers. And <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of his Commentaries ſaith, that it was they alone who in our fathers time did vexe all <hi>France,</hi> and did keepe out the <hi>Tentomanes</hi> and <hi>Cimbrians,</hi> out of their <hi>Territories;</hi> whereby it came to paſſe, that the memorie of their atchiuements, did make them valiant and full of courage in Militarie affaires. And forreine armies have found it in our age, who being freſh ſouldiers and joyning battell with the old ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, they found that the Citizens, Countrymen, and Sea-men, were al ſtout of courage. There are 17 Provinces in the low Countries, all of which the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth did poſſeſſe: in which there are 4 Dukedomes, the Dukedome of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Limburg,</hi> which together with the Countie of <hi>Dale</hi> and the Lordſhips of <hi>Valckenburg,</hi> and <hi>Rode le Due,</hi> is joyned to <hi>Brabant,</hi> and it dependeth on the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie of <hi>Brabant:</hi> alſo the Dukedomes of <hi>Lutzenburg</hi> and <hi>Gelderland.</hi> There are 7 Counties, <hi>Flanders, Arteſia, Hannonia, Holland, Zeland, Namurcium</hi> and <hi>Zutphania:</hi> alſo the Marquiſhip of the holy empire, which hath foure principall Citties, <hi>Nivella, Lovanium, Braxells,</hi> and the <hi>Metropolis Antwerpe;</hi> it is now a part of <hi>Brabant.</hi> There are five Lordſhips, or Signiories, of <hi>Weſt-Frieſland,</hi> of <hi>Mechlin,</hi> of <hi>Vltrajectum,</hi> of <hi>Tranſ-Iſaliana,</hi> and <hi>Groneland.</hi> There are many Citties, in the Low Countries, which are well fortified, the number whereof as alſo of the Townes and villages you may finde in <hi>Mercator.</hi> But the chiefe Citties are <hi>Lovaine, Bruxells, Antwerpe, Silva Ducis, Gandavum, Bruges, Hipra, Mechlinia, Cameracum, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trebatum, Tornacum, Valencena, Inſulae, Dort, Harlem, Amſterdam, Lugdunum Battavorum, Namurcum, Neomagum, Trajectum</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

They are of a ſilver ſhining colour, of a great bigneſſe. There are ſome ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken which do waigh above 400 pound. <hi>Guicciardine</hi> doth report, that be ſaw in the Market at <hi>Antwerp</hi> a Sturgeon of 420 pound waight, &amp; that it was above 12 feete of <hi>Antwerp</hi> long: and on another day in the morning he ſaw 70.

and ſo bending Northward toward <hi>Tornacum,</hi> it glideth by <hi>Aldenar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> and the famous Cittie <hi>Gandauum,</hi> where it receiveth the Rivers <hi>Liſa,</hi> and <hi>Livia,</hi> and other ſtreames. From thence with many win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and Maeander-like turnings it runneth forward to <hi>Teneremunds:</hi> and there having received the River <hi>Tenera,</hi> flowing on the right hand, it goeth toward <hi>Rupelmunda:</hi> and there it receiveth <hi>Rupels,</hi> and a little after <hi>Dela:</hi> and being now growne bigger, it by and by waſheth the walls of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and maketh a faire Haven or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for ſhippes before the Towne: afterward having runne a little further, it parteth it ſelfe into two channells, and ſo divideth <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> from <hi>Zeland:</hi> for on the left hand, it windeth and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Southward, and ſo runneth by the ſhores and borders of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and is called by another name <hi>de Hont,</hi> from the barking noyſe thereof; from whence it paſſeth by <hi>Zuytbeveland</hi> and <hi>Walachria</hi> into the Weſterne Ocean: on the right hand leaving <hi>Brabant,</hi> it keepeth one continuall courſe in his old channell, by the Iſland of <hi>Scaldis,</hi> and ſo with a violent current runnes into the Sea. Moreover the tyde fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth up into this River, even to <hi>Gandauum,</hi> which is thirty miles from the mouth of it, if you count them by the winding courſe of the bankes. There doe come up into this River Sturgeons, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mones, Troutes, great Lampreys, Turbotts, Congers, Cuckow fiſhes Mullets, Crabs, Lobſters, Sardins, and many moſt delicate fiſh, which come up out of the Sea into <hi>Scaldis,</hi> and doe there feede, and caſt their ſpawne; ſo that for two or three monethes, betweene the Spring and the Summer, beſides the greater fiſh, there is taken ſo great a number of ſmall Frie, that many men doe live by them. Alſo many Sea Dogfiſhes, and Porpoiſes doe come up this River, which two kind of fiſhes doe not caſt forth any ſpawne, but doe bring forth their young ones perfectly formed. The Dogfiſhes doe bring forth their young on the Land, and doe ſuckle them with their dugges, untill they are growne to a good bigneſſe. Moreover, this River without the helpe of the Sea, doth yeeld divers kindes of fiſh all the yeere long, of which theſe are the chiefe: Pikes, Barbells, Tenches, Carpes and Breames of an unuſuall bigneſſe, ſo that they doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, weigh 20 pound; alſo Gudgeons, and many other kindes of fiſh both great and ſmall. Alſo divers kindes of Eeles, and Crabbes, and in the mouth of the River, there are ſome Oyſters, which come thither out of the Sea.

Rucur,</hi> or <hi>Rhoer,</hi> which <hi>Tacitus</hi> calleth <hi>Adrana,</hi> as <hi>Ritheime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> writeth, doth riſe neere the Towne <hi>Bullinge,</hi> and cutting through <hi>Caeſia</hi> it glideth by <hi>Dura</hi> and <hi>Iuliacum,</hi> and at length neere <hi>Ruremun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> which it nameth, it falleth into <hi>Moſa.</hi> There are alſo other leſſer Rivers, which for brevitie ſake I forbeare to deſcribe. And I paſſe over alſo the Torrents, and greater Rivers, leaſt I ſhould be tedious to the Reader; which doe not onely yeeld great ſtore of fiſh, but are alſo an ornament and fortification to the Country, and are very convenient for the paſſing of commodities to and fro. And the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people by the helpe of theſe Rivers making Sluces and Dams to ſtay the water, doe afterward digge channells for ſome miles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and after letting the water into them doe make them navigable: ſo that there is no Cittie which hath not great Barkes, which come up unto it. But this Countrie hath but few fountaines, or Springs of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, except in the Mountainous places. And thus having ſhewed the Rivers that are in the Low Countries, it remaineth that wee ſhould ſpeake ſomewhat concerning the Ocean: ſeeing in regard it is ſo neere unto it, it may be counted not only a member of this Province, but the chiefe head thereof. I ſay therefore that the Ocean is wide and large, and in rough weather, it is fearefull and terribly furious: for ſometimes when tempeſts happen, the waves goe ſo high, that
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:23886:334"/>
it doth overflow and drowne whole Countries: and eſpecially it breaketh oftentimes in about the coaſt of <hi>Zeland:</hi> but the inhabitants doe caſt up trenches and bankes, which do prevent the danger which might enſue thereby: unleſſe when a weſterne winde doth contend and blow againſt the ſpring tide. The windes which doe moſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſea, and thereby doe endanger the Countrie, are the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt, the Weſt and the South windes. Alſo it is much troubled at the New-Moone or Full-moone, and the two Aequinoctialls, at which time (as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> witneſſeth) the Sea doth ſwell very much. For every new Moone, and full Moone, wee ſee that there are ſtill the greateſt tides and greateſt tempeſts. Theſe tides doe produce ſome good, and ſome evill effects. As for the former, it pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the water (as common experience doth teach us) and will not ſuffer it to corrupt: and alſo it maketh ſhips ſay le more ſpeedily. For as <hi>Vegeſius</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. concerning Military matters, <hi>Cap.</hi> 42. <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reciprocantis meatus ambiguitas curſum Navium ſecunda adjuvat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tardat adverſa:</hi> that is, Thoſe tides if they be with a ſhip, doe haſten her courſe; but being againſt her doe foreſlow and ſtay her courſe. The other evill effects, are the inundations, and violent irruptions of the Sea: For the Ocean doth ſometimes come up into the land with ſuch violence, that it driveth backe great Rivers, and doth overflow ſpacious fields, as we ſayd before. <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> doth write as much, and the miſerable experience of many ages doth conſume it. But ſo much concerning theſe things. And now having ſpoken of the Detriment and loſſe, which ſome Countries of this Province doe receive by the Ocean, when it is rough and troubled, we muſt ſpeake ſomewhat of the commodities, which the whole Province doth reape by it, when it is quiet and peaceable, which commodities are ſo many and ſo great, that if they ſhould want them, the Country could not ſuſtaine the halfe part of the inhabitants. And hence it comes to paſſe, that this Province is as it were the Haven and Mart of all <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo that there is an infinite multitude of Merchants and Factors, and as it were a confuſed <hi>Chaos</hi> of inhabitants and forrei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Beſides, the Ocean bringeth many commodities to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as Herring fiſhing, and other fiſhings, which ſerve not onely to ſatisfie the voluptuous deſires of the rich, but alſo to ſuſtaine the poore: and the inhabitants doe not onely get their foode, but all their wealth by it. For the over-plus of that which they take, doth furniſh a great part of <hi>France, Spaine, Germany, England,</hi> and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: yea great ſtore of barreld ſalt-fiſh is ſent even into <hi>Italy,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Salmones and Herrings. Now there are three kinds of fiſh which they ſalt, namely Herrings, Codfiſh, and Salmones. But firſt we will ſpeake of their Herring fiſhing of which they make a great commodity. Herrings are found in no River, nor in the <hi>Mediterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Sea, nor the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> nor any other Sea, but onely in this Northerne Ocean: their bigneſſe, forme, and goodneſſe is ſufficiently knowne. And when they goe out of the Northerne Sea, which is alwayes in the Spring time, as if they fleeted from their owne native quarters, and went to ſeeke ſhady places, they come in ſuch great ſhoales, that
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:23886:334"/>
no Nets can hold them, but that they breake through them, and do even darken the face of the Sea. And many broade bottom'd veſſells, which they call <hi>Buſses,</hi> are ſet out from <hi>Holland, Frieſland, France, Brittaine,</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> and doe all to avoyd contention, fiſh in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts, and quarters, either about <hi>England,</hi> or the Coaſts of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the <hi>Orcades.</hi> Theſe fiſhes are unbowelled alive if it may be (for aſſoone as they are out of the Sea waters they are dead) by one who hath good wages for doing it; and then another ſalts them, and ſo they are preſently barrelled up, and afterward ſold; afterward the Herring men and Coupers doe ſalt them anew, and take out the Pilchers which have no Milts nor Rowes, they are barrell'd up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with new pickle: afterward they are ſurveyed by men ſworne for that purpoſe, and ſo ſealed up, in like manner as <hi>Diana's</hi> Prieſt did ſeale up red Vermilion, as <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſeth. And theſe are the firſt kind of Herrings which with <hi>Plautus</hi> we may call ſalt or pickled Herrings: the other ſort are thoſe which are lightly ſalted; and ſo dryed in the ſmoake, being as yellow as gold, whence they call them <hi>Soretum,</hi> becauſe they call a red colour in their language <hi>Sorus.</hi> This Herrng fiſhing is very commodious and advantagious to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> ſeeing not onely one Citty, but many Citties doe wholy depend and live on it, and the Citty and Country get their food by it, pay their debts, maintaine families, and doe get wealth by it. There is another ſpeciall kind of fiſh which they uſe to ſalt, called in Latine <hi>Aſcllus Major,</hi> or Cod-fiſh, thereby to difference it from that which is commonly ealled <hi>Caballian.</hi> It is a great fiſh, ſo that ſome of them are threeſcore pound weight. It is taken at many times of the yeare, but eſpecially in Lent time, and chiefely in the <hi>Frieſland</hi> Sea, and great ſtore of it is uſually ſalted up, whereby the whole country reapeth yeerely great profit. The third kind of ſalt fiſh is Salmon: being very good when it is freſh as well as ſalted. <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland</hi> have ſtore of this kind of fiſh, in all moneths, but moſt plentie in <hi>Aprill, May,</hi> and <hi>Iune:</hi> of which there is ſuch great ſtore ſalted up, that the gaine which is made of them amounteth to 200000 crownes. But of theſe things enough, let us proceede to the reſt. The Low Countries are plaine and levell: there are few Hills in it, and fewer Mountaines, unleſſe it be in <hi>Lutzen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg, Namurcum,</hi> and ſome parts of <hi>Hannonia,</hi> where they are very thicke, and there are many alſo in <hi>Leodium.</hi> It is every where beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with Forreſts and Woods, which both grace the Countrie, and afford much pleaſure in hunting. The Forreſt of <hi>Arden,</hi> in <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> time, as he himſelfe writeth, was the greateſt of all <hi>France,</hi> running betweene the <hi>Treverians,</hi> from the River <hi>Rhene</hi> to the <hi>Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians,</hi> and the <hi>Rhenicans,</hi> being above fifty miles long. And now at this time no wood in all <hi>France</hi> can be compared with it: but now there is a great part of it converted into arrable ground, ſo that it is farre leſſer than it was: and that part which remaineth hath many glades made in it, which the husband men doe till, and call it by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other name, but the greateſt part of it is from <hi>Theonis Villa</hi> even to <hi>Leodium,</hi> which is thirty miles in length. In the middle of it is

the Citty of S. <hi>Hubert,</hi> which as <hi>Gemma Friſius</hi> witneſſeth, lyeth under 26 degrees of Longitude and forty minutes: and 50 degrees of Latitude, and 4. minutes. This Wood hath all kindes of pleaſant trees, which are very high, and broad-ſpreading, which afford both pleaſure and profit. <hi>Strabo</hi> calleth it <hi>Arduenna,</hi> the Inhabitants <hi>Arddenna; Rhenanus, Luitticherwald,</hi> which ſignifies the <hi>Leodienſian</hi> Wood. <hi>Mormavia,</hi> or <hi>Mormau,</hi> is a faire wood in <hi>Hannonia,</hi> which beginneth neere to <hi>Queſnoy,</hi> and ſo runneth out Southward toward the <hi>Veromanduans:</hi> and hath many Townes in it, and Villages, and many cleare ſprings and pleaſant Fountaines.

But ſo much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the woods. I come now to the publick works. There are in theſe Countries innumerable magnificent Temples, and Churches, many Abbies, infinite numbers of Monaſteries, &amp; Friaries, many Hoſpitalls for ſtrangers, for the ſick, for the poore &amp; for Orphans. Truly in <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi> only there are 42 ſuch like buildings: the chiefe of which is the Cathedral Church of S. <hi>Mary,</hi> which is very ſpacious, having a Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Steeple, which is 400 &amp; 20 foote high, being built of white Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, from the top whereof you may view the Cittie, the River cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſhips, and the Countrie round about which is full of Townes and Citties. What ſhould I deſcribe the other Temples, Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and ſuch like places, of which there are great ſtore both heere and in other Citties and Townes? What ſhould I reckon up the ſumptuous Pallaces belonging to Dukes, Earles, and Noblemen? Or what ſhould I mention the other publicke or private buildings? for if I ſhould endeavour to reckon them up, I ſhould ſooner want time than matter; wherefore it is better to be ſilent, than to ſpeake too ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly. The politick ſtate of theſe Countries both in generall and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall is threefold: the firſt is the Eccleſiaſtick ſtate, in which the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots are the chiefe, the ſecond is of the Nobility, as the Duks, Earles, Marcgraves, Princes, Barrons, and great Lords. The third is of the Citties, which the chiefe Citties of every Country doe repreſent. Theſe ſtates the Prince calleth together, when they are to conſult concerning matters appertaining to the Prince, or to the Principality, or to the preſervation or utility of the Countrie. The Eccleſiaſticke ſtate is thus; there are foure Biſhops in the Low Countries, the <hi>Camaracenſian,</hi> the <hi>Tornaycenſian,</hi> and the <hi>Atrebate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lovaine</hi> is famous for the many Colledges, Students, and learned men; the chiefe Colledges are <hi>Lilium, Caſtrenſe,</hi> the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Porus</hi> and <hi>Falcon,</hi> in which Philoſophie is read. The <hi>Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidian</hi> Colledge hath three languages taught in it, namely, Greeke, Latine, and Hebrew. This Vniverſitie, at the requeſt of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of <hi>Brabant,</hi> was firſt inſtituted and adorned with Priviledges by <hi>Iohn</hi> the 4, Duke of <hi>Brabant,</hi> in the yeare 1426. <hi>Martinus</hi> the fifth being Pope. The other were erected in our memory. Out of which as it were out of the <hi>Troian</hi> horſe innumerable learned men have proceeded, and doe dayly come from thence. For in the Low
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:23886:336"/>
Countries there are learned men, skilfull in all faculties and ſciences: and as heretofore, ſo now it produceth famous Schollers; whom it would be too tedious to reckon up. Here are divers Libraries in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places, which are repleniſhed with excellent rare Bookes. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which that at <hi>Leyden</hi> is the chiefe. The inhabitants are faire, quiet, not cholericke, nor ambitious, nor proud: not much given to venerie; civill, plaine, curteous, affable, ingenious and ready, witty, and ſometimes talkative: laborious, induſtrious, faithfull, gratefull towards thoſe that have done them a curteſie, capable of all Arts and Sciences, ſtout in defending their liberties, and Priviledges even to death. And this may truely be ſpoken in the generall prayſe of them, that the Low Country men are frugall houſe keepers and thrifty huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands: who following the example of the Ant, do lay up before win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that which cannot then be gotten; and doe buy fiſh and fleſh, which they either pickle up, or doe dry it in the ſmoake. For every houſe, according to the number of their familie, doth kill in Autumne an whole Oxe, or provideth halfe an one, beſide a Hogge, which they ſalt up, and then it will ſerve them to ſpend a good part of the yeare, untill the Spring returne againe. Yet many of them are very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, and deſirous of wealth. The Women are beautifull, well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd and curteous. For according to their Country faſhion, they are uſed from their childhood to converſe familiarly with every one: and therefore they are very ready both in action or ſpeech or any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: neither doth this freedome or liberty make them leſſe honeſt. Neither doe they onely walke alone through the Cittie, but they will goe for fellowſhip to the next Townes, without any the leaſt ſuſpition of diſhoneſtie. They are very continent, and apt and ready in their affaires And they are not onely carefull of houſhold matters, of which their husbands take no care, but they alſo uſe Merchandiſe, and diſpatch and conferre of buſineſſes belonging unto men: and that with ſo great dexterity and diligence, that in many of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, as in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> the men do commit all their affaires unto them. And by this manner of living, joyned with the innate deſire which women have to rule, they become for the moſt part too Imperious and proud. It is the faſhion both among Princes, and men of inferior ranke, as alſo among other Nations, on this ſide the <hi>Alpes,</hi> to give the firſt born their Parents names, althogh they be yet living. And the Noble of what quality and condition ſoever they are, doe more eſteeme of their eldeſt daughter, than the reſt of the younger, although they have all an equall dowry: ſo that they marry the reſt to thoſe unto whom they denyed her in marriage, reſerving her for a better husband. And they are to be prayſed, becauſe they eaſily contract marriages with forrainers, if occaſion ſo require, and are not bound to match them in their owne Country, which is a matter ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable and commodious: for theſe alliances by marriage are very advantagious to themſelves and the Commonwealth. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is accounted undecent and abſur'd, for young men to marry old women, or on the contrary for old men to marry young maydes: as alſo for a noble perſonage to marry an ignoble perſon, or a maſter
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:23886:336"/>
to marry his Maide, and a Miſtreſſe her ſervant. But the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men are chiefely given to Mechanicke Arts, but not of the baſe and ſervile ſort, but the more nobler, as weaving, clothing, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of hangings, &amp; tapeſtry, which ſerve not only for the uſe of their owne country: but are alſo tranſported into <hi>France, Spaine, Germany,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and alſo into <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Affricke.</hi> For Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, there is no Nation that doth excell it, nor none doth excell in Muſicke, or for variety of Languages. <hi>Iohn Eickius</hi> a Low country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, did firſt ſhew the way how to mingle colours with oyle. And every one in <hi>Flanders, Brabant,</hi> or <hi>Zeland,</hi> can ſpeake not onely their owne Country ſpeech which is Low-Dutch, but alſo <hi>French.</hi> The Sea men, Merchants, and Schollers, can ſpeake alſo <hi>Italian, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> for the moſt part: and ſome can underſtand <hi>Hebrew,</hi> the <hi>Chaldean,</hi> and <hi>Arabicke</hi> language. The Lowcountrie men are alſo skilfull Seamen. I come to their food, the Lowcountry men doe uſe Wheate, Rye, Oates, and Barly: they eſteeme of no pulſe but Beanes, and Peaſe: they have few Vetches and no Millet at all. For the great ſtrong windes doe lay it, and ſpoyle it. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people maintaine their families ſoberly and frugally. Their drinke is for the moſt part Beere, which is made of Malt, into which they afterward put ſome ground Barly, and Hops. And this is a very good and wholeſome drinke for thoſe that are uſed to it; they doe alſo drinke much milke. The rich have wine. They eate commonly Rye bread. They are wont alſo upon Feſtivall dayes, eſpecially thoſe which beare their owne name, to make great feaſts, and to invite their Parents, Kinſemen, and friends unto them, and to banquet ſumptuouſly with them, and to ſhew themſelves generous and magnificent. They keepe their houſes very neate and cleane, being furniſhed with all kinds of neceſſary houſhold ſtuffe. And truly it is a faire ſight to ſee what ſtore of houſholdſtuffe they have, and how well ordered it is, and how cleane it is kept; in which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt it doth excell all the Nations of the World. But the Low Countriemen are too much given to the Vice of drinking, in which they take great delight, ſo that oftentimes they never give over drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king day nor night; and thereby beſides other inconveniences, they do much wrong their bodyes and witts: and without doubt it is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the cauſe of their untimely death, according to that of <hi>Properti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us:</hi>

On the ſide of the Town there is an ancient Caſtell. In which the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and the Admirall of the Seas, (the firſt being taken at <hi>Hiſdinum,</hi> the latter at Saint <hi>Quintins</hi> Cittie,) were both kept priſoners. This Caſtle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be now disjoyned from the Towne, yet it was formerly joyned thereunto, by many edifices, which the <hi>Brugians</hi> did purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pull downe.

Over againſt this Cittie is a ſmall Iſland which the inhabitants call <hi>Cadſant,</hi> in which there is a Towne of the ſame name. It was heretofore much larger, having a Cittie in it, and many pleaſant and rich townes. Neere unto which at ſeverall times there have beene many ſea fights: when either the <hi>Brittaines,</hi> the <hi>Batavians,</hi> or any other enemies to <hi>Flanders</hi> did arrive heere. But this Iſland is more than half worn away by the tempeſtuous Seas, &amp; by the tides and ebs thereof.

There is alſo <hi>Damme</hi> two miles from <hi>Sluce,</hi> which is a very rich Towne, being very populous, and full of Merchants, and a great Haven for wines,<note place="margin">Damme.</note> being a key of the Sea, in regard that it did ſhut and open the Ocean, both to thoſe of <hi>Bruges,</hi> and to all Merchants.

There came hither eight great Whales in the yeare 1404, every one of them being 74 foote long. Alſo in the yeare 1426, there was a great Sea Hogge taken, being like unto a Land-Hogge but that it was greater. But in the yeare 1099. and in the yeare 1200, in the Archduke <hi>Alberts</hi> time, the <hi>Flandrians</hi> to reſtraine the incurſions of the enimie, did ditch it round about, and yet they could not hinder their inroades, although it were entren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with 17 Baracadoes and <hi>Bulwarkes,</hi> as the Bulwark or Fort of S. <hi>Catherine,</hi> of <hi>Iſabell,</hi> of <hi>Albert,</hi> of <hi>Clara;</hi> wherfore the <hi>Flandrians</hi> were very deſirous to beſeige this Cittie, which they attempted on the 5 of <hi>Iuly</hi> the yere 1601. The beginning of the ſeige was very terrible, and continued ſo to the end thereof, as it is well knowne; yea it was ſuch a long and grievous ſeige as there was never the like in the memory of man, ſo that during the time of this ſeige, there were ſlaine on both ſides about 110000 men.

<pb n="448" facs="tcp:23886:342"/>
other matters. Moreover, there was a battaile fought betweene <hi>Oſtend</hi> and <hi>Newport,</hi> on the ſecond of <hi>Iuly</hi> in the yeere 1600, between the Archduke <hi>Albert,</hi> and <hi>Grave Maurice,</hi> in which there were ſlaine on both ſides ſeaven thouſand foote and horſemen.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Oraſmuch as the Romaine Empire is in the power of the <hi>Germaines,</hi> and very politickely divided into parts, I thinke it a matter worth my labour to ſet before your eyes the order and diſpoſition of thoſe parts, as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in a writing called <hi>Matricula Imperij:</hi> and afterward to ſhew you in Tables the ſeverall members of this Empire, that the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Reader may finde in what Country they are ſituated. But I have gotten two Coppies of this <hi>Matricula,</hi> the one written; the other printed at <hi>Venice</hi> in <hi>Italian,</hi> being both much corrupted. And I know that the Empire is now divided in another manner. Therefore let no man blame me, or be offended, if he finde ſome parts that are recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as belonging to the Empire, doe not belong thereunto, for it is not my intention to ſpeake expreſſely of all the ſeverall parts of this Empire, neither was it poſſible for me to do, out of ſuch corrupt Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies; eſpecially ſeeing that I know that a great part of the Empire, came into the hands of private Princes, either by Exchange, or Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, or gifts, for their good ſervice in defence of the Empire, or for ſome other cauſes. Neither is it my part to proſecute thoſe things which belong to Politicians, and not Geographers, but onely I ſought that out of this Coppie of <hi>Matricula,</hi> I might ſhew the elegant diſpoſition and diviſion of the Empire of <hi>Germany,</hi> and might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how the ſtuddies of Geographie, and <hi>Policie</hi> doe mutually illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate one another. This is therefore the order of the Empire.</p>

Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi> writeth, that many kindes of wilde beaſts are bred in the Wood <hi>Hercynia,</hi> which are not ſeene in any other place; of which (ſaith hee) thoſe that differ moſt from the reſt, and are moſt worthy of remembrance are theſe: there is a kinde of Oxe which is like a Hart, which hath in the middle of his forehead one high horne, and more ſtraite than uſuall, from the toppe whereof large Antletts or Tines doe ſpread forth; the male and femall are of one ſhape, and have one as bigge hornes as the other. There is alſo a beaſt called Alcis, which is like unto a Goate, but it is ſomewhat bigger, and having no hornes at all, and their legges are without joynts, ſo that they cannot by any meanes lye downe to their reſt, or if they fall downe by chance, they cannot riſe up againe; therefore they leane againſt trees, and ſo they take their reſt: and when the hunters have found by their
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:23886:389"/>
footing where they uſually haunt, they either ſtub up all the trees, or elſe they cut them halfe downe, and ſo leave them ſtanding: So that when the beaſts reſt againſt them according to their uſuall manner, they overthrow the trees with their weight, and ſo fall downe with them. The third kind of beaſts are thoſe which are called <hi>Vri,</hi> which are almoſt as bigge as Elephants, and like Bulls in ſhape and colour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are very ſtrong, and ſwift, and will prey on men and beaſts: theſe they uſually take in trappes, and ſo kill them. But now I come to the auncient government. The ſacred Romaine Empire, which being divided into the Weſt and Eaſterne part, was much weakned by the excurſions of divers Nations, and rent by civill diſſentions, was ready to be ruined by its owne weight; having forſooke <hi>Italie</hi> did ſeeke defence and ſtrength in no other Countrie but <hi>Germanie,</hi> and choſe <hi>Charles</hi> the Great King of <hi>France</hi> to be Emperour, who as they report, was borne at <hi>Ingelheimij,</hi> which is a village Towre two miles from <hi>Moguntiacum,</hi> and built there a famous Pallace, whoſe ruines may be yet ſeene. The Empire remained in <hi>Charles</hi> his line an hundred yeares, and above: which afterward failing, it was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to <hi>Conrade</hi> Duke of <hi>Franconia:</hi> after whom followed <hi>Henry Fowler:</hi> after him the three <hi>Ottoes:</hi> the laſt whereof when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that the <hi>Romaines, Creſcentius</hi> being conſull, did affect and deſire the title of the Empire, he rayſed an army and tooke <hi>Rome,</hi> and obtayned of Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> that the <hi>Germaines</hi> ſhould have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

eſpecially in the generall deſcription of <hi>Belgia:</hi> we will ſpeake firſt concerning the tide of the Sea, and afterward we will reckon up the properties of the <hi>Germaine</hi> Sea. It is manifeſt that the Moone is the cauſe of the tides of the Ocean. But as the Moone hath divers chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in her motion, ſo the tides doe alſo change. For they following the Moone, doe flow twice betweene the riſing thereof, and doe ebbe twice in foure and twentie houres: ſo that the Seas doe flow twice, and ebbe twice every day: they flow when the Moone aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth above the Eaſterne <hi>Horizon,</hi> and do ebb when it declineth from the <hi>Meridian</hi> weſtward; and it floweth againe when the Moone goeth downe under the earth, and commeth to the contrary part of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian,</hi> and ſo likewiſe it ebbeth untill it riſe againe. But as the Moone does not alwayes riſe at one time, and in one place, but every day ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in another place than it did before: ſo the tides doe not flow at certaine houres, but at that time when the Moone paſſeth through the Poles of the heavens. Moreover it is to bee noted, that the full Moone doth move the Sea in another manner than the halfe Moone. For this <hi>Luminarie</hi> hath greater force when it is at the full, than when it is weake, and in the waine. We uſe to call thoſe tides which are a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the full of the Moone <hi>Sprinckuloedt,</hi> that is, a Spring-tide. Which <hi>Agel Lib.</hi> 14. concerning the Ocean, doth elegantly call the Moones companion, ſeeing it followeth the age and increaſe thereof; and alſo he noteth ſome aſpects, and configurations: As for example ſake, if the Moone have a fit aſpect unto <hi>Venus,</hi> and doe run through moiſt houſes, it doth wonderfully increaſe the tides of the ſea: but if it be aſpected with <hi>Mars,</hi> or dry Planets, it doth leſſen the tides. Here alſo the aſcention of the ſignes is to be noted. But if the Moon be in ſignes of a right aſcenſion, it maketh the tides longer than if it were in ſignes of oblique aſcenſion: for it is obſerved that the tides are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver equall to the ebbes in continuance of time; but when the Moone is in the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> ſignes and hath no Latitude. Beſides, ſome parts of the water doe finde a greater influence proceeding from the beames of the bodie of the Moone, either in regard of the rectitude and ſtraightneſſe of the beames, or ſome other hidden qualitie. But the Moone hath a different influence when it is Northward, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when it is Southward; for when it is heere it encreaſes the tides on the Southerne ſhoares, and when it is there, on the Northerne ſhoa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as concerning this our <hi>Germaine</hi> Sea, it is certaine that there are ſcarce any tides which can be perceived, but as the Sea is carried with the windes, it ſoweth now here and now there: for when it is an Eaſt wind, the Sea goeth very high, and driveth backe Rivers, neither doth it flow onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

is worthy to be mentioned, that whereas all other Seas are bitter and ſalt, our Sea hath ſweete waters and not unpleaſant to drinke, and that in regard that many great freſh Rivers doe runne into it out of the <hi>Sarmatian</hi> Mountaines, and becauſe the Sunne is too weake in thoſe places to exhale and draw up the lighter and thinner parts of the water, which ſome make to bee the chiefe cauſe of the ſaltneſſe of the Sea. Which reaſon if it were good and probable, then the <hi>Amalchian</hi> Sea alſo, and the <hi>Chronian</hi> Sea ſhould not be ſalt, which is otherwiſe. Wherefore it is rather to be held that the melted ſnow, and the aforeſayd Rivers flowing downe out of the <hi>Sarmatian</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, doe make this Sea cleere and ſweete. Whereby it comes to paſſe, that other Seas doe more eaſily carry veſſells of great burden, than this. And the reaſon is becauſe the water of the ſalt Sea is of a thicker ſubſtance, while the thinner waters doe yeeld to the leaſt waight. It is eaſier alſo to ſwim in this Sea than in others. Yet it maketh Sea men more ſicke, in regard the waves got very high, ſo that ſometimes they ſeeme to touch the Clouds, and then fall againe and breake into deepe valleyes. This Sea in divers places, hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers appellations, or names; For ſometimes it is called the <hi>Germaine</hi> Ocean, from <hi>Germanie</hi> which is neere unto it, and it reacheth from the <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Sea, which lyeth Weſtward, even to <hi>Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi> in the Eaſt.

It is built even from the foundation to the toppe, of free ſquare ſtone; it hath many open places to receive the ayre and the winde, and the aſcent and going up unto it is by foure ſtaires; but when the bredth of it begins to leſſen, and grow ſharpe towards the toppe, there are eight ſtaires.

Now I come to their manners.

But <hi>Tacitus</hi> who lived amongſt them ſaith, that the ſouldiers are very couragious, and that it is a warlike Nation, but are neither cunning nor crafty, but doe diſcover their owne mindes and ſecrets, and very faithfull in keeping ſecrets committed to them. Alſo the Emperour <hi>Iulianus</hi> in his <hi>Miſopogne</hi> ſaith, that hee knoweth by experience that this Nation cannot flatter, but that they deale freely and plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all men. <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> 11. <hi>Quadrip.</hi> ſaith, that they muſt needes be of a quiet and peaceable diſpoſition, in regard of the qualitie of the Countrie which they inhabit. Concerning their religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the mindes of men are held and bound together by the tye and feare of ſome Deity, the <hi>Germaines</hi> (as <hi>Caeſar</hi> writeth) doe uſe no ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, they account them onely to be gods whom they ſee, and from whom they receive ſome benefit: as the Sunne, and <hi>Vulcan,</hi> and the Moone. But afterward, as it appeareth in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> who lived under the reigne of the Emperour <hi>Nerva;</hi> they had many other gods: as <hi>Mercury, Hercules, Mars, Iſis,</hi> and <hi>Berecinthia:</hi> alſo a certaine god called <hi>Alcis.</hi> The ſame <hi>Tacitus</hi> doth report alſo that <hi>Velleda</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinia</hi> were accounted as Gods. And the aforeſaid <hi>Tacitus</hi> maketh mention of the Temple of <hi>Tanfana,</hi> who ſaith that the <hi>Suevians</hi> doe reverence the mother Earth, which they call (as <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But they did chiefely reverence <hi>Mercury</hi> or <hi>Teutates,</hi> and offered humaine ſacrifices thereunto, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth. In the time of peace there was no common Magiſtrate, but in the time of warre they did chuſe Governours. They ſpent all their life time in military affaires: and to rob was accounted no diſgrace, as we may reade in <hi>Caeſar. Seneca</hi> ſaith, that their chiefe delight was the warres in which they were both borne and bread. If (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> witneſſeth) they have peace any long time together at home in their owne Country, then they goe to the warres in other Nations. They cary about with them their mothers, wives, and children, who doe carry their knapſackes, and proviſion: neither are they afraide of plagues. They joyne battell with ſongs and warlike ſounds. They count it a great diſgrace to loſe their buckler in the field, ſo that many after the battle for griefe thereof have hang'd themſelves. <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Herodotus</hi> do report; that they will march over Rivers in regard they are lightly armed, and of an high ſtature.

Thus <hi>Tacitus</hi> reporteth. The Mothers doe nurſe their owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and doe not put them forth to Nurſes. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaith, that they account it unlawfull to wrong a ſtranger, which commeth unto them upon any occaſion, ſo that they are ready to protect them from all injuries: their houſes ſtand open, and they eate one with another. And here good manners prevaile more, than good lawes in other places. The greateſt part of their food, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> mentioneth, doth conſiſt in milke, cheeſe, and fleſh. <hi>Plinny</hi> witneſſeth that they live by no other graine but Oates; and <hi>Mela</hi> addeth that in times of want they will eate raw fleſh. At dinners as <hi>Athenaeus</hi> witneſſeth, they have peeces of meate roaſted, and they drinke milke and wine. Their fare is homely, as the fleſh of wilde beaſts, Crabbes, or ſowre milke: their drinke is made of Barley and wheate, neither is there any Nation more magnificent in entertainment or in feaſting. But as to man or Nation is without ſome vice, ſo they count it no ſhame to drinke night and day. Concerning their habit, <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith that they all weare a kinde of Cloake button'd before, which looſely hangeth over their ſhoulders: the ſame <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Germaines</hi> did not weare a looſe garment but a ſtraite bodyed garment, ſuch as <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius</hi> ſaith the <hi>French</hi> did uſe.

It is very conveniently ſituated, and hath a faire proſpect into a faire plaine, which is cloathed with greene graſſe and herbage: but eſpecially from a high Tower, which from the weather cocke is called the <hi>Swanne</hi> Tower. <hi>Calcaria</hi> is a Towne in the Iſland of <hi>Rhene,</hi> which was built firſt by the Earles of <hi>Cleveland,</hi> as a Fort and Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Garriſon to prevent the incurſions &amp; inroades of theſe of <hi>Colen</hi> and <hi>Gelria,</hi> with whom they had often warres.

But when they fight in the ayre, they both ſtrive which ſhould get uppermoſt; if the Hawke be above her, he comes downe upon her with great violence, and kills her. But to the matter. There were alwayes Praefects of the Pallace, eſpecially in the Emperours Court, which the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> did heretofore call the Majors, of the houſe or Pallace. But at what time the Countie <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi> of <hi>Rhene</hi> was inſtituted, and where the <hi>Palatines</hi> of <hi>Rhene</hi> did keepe their reſidence foure hundred or five hundred yeares agoe, I cannot determine, ſeeing there are divers different conjectures. Some ſay the firſt <hi>Palatines,</hi> were onely Noble men untill the time of <hi>Otto</hi> the third, at what time they were made Princes Electors: for they had more dignity. The firſt Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> was <hi>Henry,</hi> who with the other Electors in the yeare 1003 did chuſe the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Henry.</hi> But <hi>Munſter</hi> ſaith that he doth not finde it mentioned in any writings, either where he kept his Court, or what Country he governed, or what people were ſubject unto him; but ſome doe ſuppoſe, but without any certaine ground, that the Princes <hi>Palatine</hi> did heretofore keepe their reſidence at <hi>Wormacia,</hi> and had great power in that Citie. It is manifeſt, that <hi>Conradus</hi> Duke of <hi>Franconiae</hi> in the yeere 742 did reſide at <hi>Wormes,</hi> but not the Prince <hi>Palatine.</hi> This was the ſeate heretofore of the <hi>Intuergians,</hi> the <hi>Nemetians,</hi> and the <hi>Vangionians,</hi> as ſome doe ſuppoſe. The <hi>Intrergians</hi> were a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Germanie,</hi> which <hi>Peucerus</hi> doth place in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> neere to <hi>Heydelberg,</hi> which Country was alſo called <hi>Capellatium</hi> and <hi>Pallas</hi> as we ſayd before. Thoſe whom <hi>Ptolomie</hi> and others call the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metians,</hi> were a people in <hi>Germanie</hi> neere the <hi>Rhene,</hi> confining on the <hi>Metenſians, Argentimentians,</hi> and <hi>Wormacenſians; Rhenanus</hi> calleth it now the <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> Cittie of <hi>Spires,</hi> and <hi>Aethicus</hi> calleth it <hi>Auguſta Nemetum.</hi> Alſo thoſe whom <hi>Ptolomie</hi> calleth <hi>Vangiones,</hi> are a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Germanie,</hi> neere the <hi>Rhene: Rhenanus</hi> and <hi>Lichtenavius</hi> doe call them <hi>Wormbſer-Biſthumbs.</hi> But <hi>Pirchaymerus</hi> on the contrary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth that the <hi>Vangionians</hi> are thoſe of <hi>Spires,</hi> and the <hi>Nemetians</hi>

It is manifeſt that the <hi>Germanes</hi> were originally and aunciently called <hi>Germanes</hi> as appeares by others writings, as alſo out of <hi>Procopius Caeſarienſis,</hi> who was a ſharpe ſighted and judicious writer. The firſt Prince of <hi>Franconia</hi> was <hi>Genebaldus,</hi> who was governour thereof thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares. After him there ſucceeded <hi>Marcomirus, Dagobert, Ludovicke</hi> the firſt, <hi>Marcomirus</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Waramund alias Pharamund,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made King of <hi>France</hi> left his Dukedome to his brother <hi>Marcomer:</hi> alſo <hi>Prunmeſſer, Genebald</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Suno, Luitemarus, Hugbaldus, Helmericus, Gotefrid, Genebald</hi> the third, <hi>Ludovick</hi> the third, after whom there followed <hi>Erebart, Ludovicke</hi> the fourth, <hi>Goſpert</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Hetacus</hi> the laſt Duke, who dying without an heyre, he left the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to <hi>Wituninus</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> who was alſo called <hi>Pepin,</hi> which afterward his ſonne <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, gave to <hi>Burchard</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Viceburg,</hi> and to his ſucceſſors after him, and ſo beſtowed it on the Church, in the yeare 752. It is now a Dukedome which tittle the Biſhop of <hi>Herbipolis</hi> aſſumeth to himſelfe. Yet all <hi>Franconia</hi> is not ſubject unto him. For <hi>Kitzinga</hi> and <hi>Briſtadium</hi> are ſubject to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and <hi>Gralingiacum</hi> to the Biſhop of <hi>Babenberg.</hi> Alſo <hi>Chronacum, Forchimium, Staphelſteinium, Hoch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtadium</hi> are under the biſhop of <hi>Herbipolis. Koningſpergum, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enfordia, Carolaſtadium, Hasfordia,</hi> and <hi>Biſchofſheim, Alderburg, Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleburg,</hi> and ſome other townes are ſubject to the Biſhop of <hi>Mogun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinum. Colburg</hi> belongeth to the Duke of <hi>Saxonie. Wirceburg;</hi> which <hi>Conradus Corta</hi> calleth <hi>Erebipolis, Ligurinus Herbipolis, Spanhemius Marcopolis, Ptolemaeus, Artaunum,</hi> and the inhabitants <hi>Wirtzburg,</hi> from a ſweete kinde of wort or drinke, which the Countrie of <hi>Herbipolis</hi> doth yeeld: is the Metropolis and Mother Cittie of Eaſt <hi>France,</hi> in which <hi>Boniface</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Moguntinum</hi> in the yeare of Chriſt 751 erected a Biſhopricke. It is ſituated on a plaine, being encompaſſed on every ſide with faire hills, pleaſant gardens, and fruitefull Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and alſo well fortified with ditches, rampires, walls, Towers, and Bulwarkes. It is full of Cittizens, and hath many faire buildings. On the Weſt <hi>Moenus</hi> runneth by it, which is a navigable River, and it hath a ſtone bridge ſtanding over it, which is built on ſtrong piles. Neere the River <hi>Moenus</hi> there is a Caſtell ſeated on the Mountaine, which hath held out many ſeiges, and therefore ſeemes to be impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. At the foote of the Mountaine there is a Monaſterie, which was built by <hi>Burchard,</hi> at the coſt and charges of <hi>Cumbert</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> in honour of the great confeſſor. But it would not bee much from our preſent purpoſe, to know the forme and order of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auguration and conſecration of the Biſhops and Dukes of <hi>Wirceburg.</hi> After the deceaſe of the former Biſhop, the Biſhop that is deſigned en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into the Cittie with a great troupe of horſe. Being come into the Cittie he alighteth from his horſe, and having put off his richeſt roabe, foure Earles doe bring him into our Saviours Church, or houſe, bare headed, and barefooted, in a poore weede or habit, girt about with a little cord. The officiall Earles are the Lords of <hi>Hennenbergh, Caſtel, Werthein,</hi> and <hi>Reineck.</hi> Then the Deane together with the Clergie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth to meete him, and asketh him what he ſeekes? or what hee
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:23886:458"/>
deſireth? And then he anſwereth very ſubmiſſively, That though unworthy he is now ready to take upon him that office, unto which he was choſen, and to diſcharge it faithfully. Then the Deane ſaith; In the name of the Chapter I doe here commit unto thy charge the houſe of the Saviour of the world, and the Dukedome annexed to it, in the Name of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he followeth the Clergie into our Saviours houſe, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put on the Pontificall roabe, he firſt heares Maſſe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hath a banket, but firſt the body of the Biſhop deceaſed is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boweld and ſet downe in the Chappell of the Caſtle: and his heart being tooke out is put in a glaſſe veſſell. The next day he is brought out of the Caſtle into Saint <hi>Iames</hi> his Monaſterie, holding in his right hand a Crozier, and in his left a ſword; the third day they goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to our Saviours houſe, where after Dirges and prayer, he is at laſt buried with a Crozier and a ſword. The other Citties are that which <hi>Ptolemie</hi> calls <hi>Bamberg; Peter Appianus</hi> calleth it <hi>Graniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> and <hi>Granionarion</hi> in a Greeke booke: it was at firſt called <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemberg,</hi> that is, the Mountaine of <hi>Baba,</hi> from <hi>Baba</hi> the daughter of <hi>Otto</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxonie,</hi> and wife to <hi>Albert</hi> Earle of <hi>Babemberg:</hi> others doe call this Cittie <hi>Pfawenberg;</hi> it is a very pleaſant Cittie, ſituated by the River <hi>Regnuz.</hi> It hath many Mountaines, Hills, and Gardens, and a very fruitfull ſoyle, where great ſtore of Muſmillians and Liquerize doe grow. It is an Epiſcopall Seate; and as it hath bread many happy wits, ſo it glorieth chiefely in <hi>Ioachim Camerarius</hi> a man famous for all kind of learning, as appeareth by his workes ſet out by him, which are read with much admiration. There is alſo <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cefort,</hi> or <hi>Francoford,</hi> by the River <hi>Moene,</hi> which is commonly called <hi>Franck Furtam Mayn,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from the other <hi>Franckofort</hi> which is ſituated by <hi>Odera. Munſter</hi> writeth that it was heretofore called <hi>Helenopolis,</hi> but he doth not ſhew when or from whence it was ſo called. <hi>Henry Stephanus</hi> calleth it in his <hi>Emconion</hi> of this Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the <hi>Academie</hi> of the Muſes, the <hi>Athens</hi> of <hi>Franckford,</hi> the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>Mercuriall</hi> Faires, and the Compendium or Epitome of all the Marts of the world.

It is now an Emperiall Cittie, and famous through the whole world for two Marts or Faires. Heere the Electors doe chuſe the <hi>Romaine</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, and if there be competitors that ſtand for the Empire, they doe here fight for it, and try it by battell.

It hath a fruitefull ſoyle on either ſide of the River <hi>Rhene,</hi> which yeeldeth great ſtore of wine. It is large and well fortified, and very populous on that ſide which is toward <hi>Rhene:</hi> but on the other ſide it hath few inhabitants; it is very long but narrow There are faire houſes built after the <hi>Romane</hi> faſhion, and magnificent Collegiate Churches, with the Biſhops Caſtle.

it is thought that the Art of <hi>Printing</hi> was invented here. It is ſubject to the Archbiſhop who is elector, and Chanceller of the Empire.

So that a ditch was made
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:23886:466"/>
betweene the aforeſoyd Rivers, which was two miles long, and three hundered foote broade. But this worke came to nothing, for by reaſon of the raine, and that the ſoyle was a Mooriſh kind of earth, the worke could not ſtand, for the earth fell downe in the night, and filled up as much as they had digged in the day time. Neere the Towne <hi>Weiſeberg,</hi> there are ſome tokens yet remaining of this vaine attempt. It is to bee noted that all the Rivers of <hi>Nortgow</hi> have Iron mills and other mettall mills, ſo that they doe blow the bellowes, and drive the two hammers with their ſtreames, ſo that the Smith neede but put the Iron under the Hammers on the Anvill, and the water will make the Hammers forge it. There is in this Countrie the Mount <hi>Pinifer,</hi> commonly called <hi>Fitchtelbergk,</hi> being ſixe miles about: out of which there doe flow foure famous Rivers, <hi>Moenus, Nabus, Sala,</hi> and <hi>Egra,</hi> which winding in the figure of a croſſe; doe runne toward the foure ſeverall corners of the world. This Mountaine doth produce divers kind of mettalls, and the beſt blew colour, which is called <hi>Lazurus.</hi> There is Lead alſo found on the top of the Mountaine, and many pits, out of which mettalls were formerly digged. This Country alſo is, very where cloathed with ſome pieces of the wood <hi>Hercinia,</hi> as <hi>Weiſenburwalt, Behe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merwalt,</hi> and others, which are repreſented in this Table. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver when <hi>Bavaria</hi> had received the Chriſtian faith, there were lawes made, enacted for the government of the Land, namely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the libertie of the Church, concerning Church-burners, and Incendiaries, concerning thoſe that tooke Sanctuarie, concerning ſtrikers of the Clergie, concerning Tithes, ſeditious perſons; alſo Martiall Lawes, Lawes for the tenure of Lands, for Brokage; for titles of inhaeritances, for buying and ſelling, &amp;c. Theſe lawes the <hi>Bavarians</hi> obeyed for many yeares, and ſome of them they doe ſtill obey. And here I cannot chuſe but adde ſome of the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Lawes. It was enacted that the Iudge, to the end hee might judge rightly, ſhould have the Booke of the Statutes, and that thereby he ſhould determine and end all ſutes and controverſies. Neither ſhould the Iudges reſpect perſons or gifts, but when he had Iudged right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſhould have the ninth part of the compoſition money. But if wrongfully, he ſhould pay twice as much, as he had tooke away by his unjuſt judgement: and moreover ſhould be fined fortie ſhillings. He that ſold any thing for a certaine price, ſhould ſet downe the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in writing, and have witneſſes thereunto. No bargaine or ſale unleſſe it were free and voluntarie, ſhould be firme and currant.

The Germaine ſpeech doth acknowledge the name of Alpes, for Alp or Alpen ſignifies in their language paſturing Mountaines, on which no Hay is cut or got againſt Winter, but onely Oxen and other heards of Cattell are put there to graze. <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth that theſe Mountaines were heretofore called <hi>Albia</hi> and <hi>Alpioni: Stephanus</hi> alſo calleth them <hi>Alpia</hi> and <hi>Alpij.

Churches, of which ſeven are chiefly reſorted unto for Religion ſake; the firſt is Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church in the Vatican: which exceedeth all the Churches in the World for coſtly Marble worke, and magnificent building.

The Popes Palace is in the higheſt part of the Valitan, being fairely ſeated: who leaving his Lateran Palace, did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moove thither in regard of the pleaſantneſſe and wholeſomeneſſe of the Seate.

The Staires are broad and eaſie to aſcend, ſo that one may ride on Horſeback to the top of the Houſe. For it is ſo great that it ſeemeth rather a Town than a Houſe, there is <hi>Xiſtus</hi> Chapell which is as big as a great Church, whether when the See is vacant, the Cardinals doe meete together to create a Pope, which is commonly called the Conclave. It would be tedious to mention the other Palaces, and therefore we will paſſe to other matters.

And hence proceedeth that great plenty of Doctors, and famous men learned in divers Arts and Diſciplines. It would be troubleſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me to reckon up a Catalogue of them, and tedious to the Reader. Moreover, the Italians doe exceed other people for courteous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, for gentleneſſe, and for witty conference, and diſcourſe. They are very ingenious and witty, quick of invention, and very do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, in matters of ſtudy, and alſo in learning divers Arts.

The Italians were heretofore ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhly adicted to many ſuperſtitions. But now they doe all religiouſly obſerve the Ceremonies and Rites of the Romane Church: but that ſome few in the Southerne part of <hi>Italy</hi> do follow the Graecian Rites, who are alſo deſcended of the Graecians. But what a warlike people the Italians have beene, the conqueſt of the world doth declare. And the aforeſaid Manuſcript doth ſhew which Citties doe exceed others in matter of Warre. In warlike affaires the Peruſinians are ſtout: the Calabrians raſh: the Spoletanians crafty: the Senenſians for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate: the Bononians fierce: the Neapolitans couragious: the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines are mitigators of their enemy: the Pratenſians ſacrilegious: the Collenſians luſtfull: the Picenians ravenous: the Aemilians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate: the Placentinians cruell: the Romanes valiant: the Mediolanians undaunted: the Vincentinians deſirous of revenge: the Piſtorians bloody: the Papienſians firme and conſtant. Their Diet is ſober and frugall, and they are not curious in furniſhing their Tables, but when neceſſity requires. They doe not all weare one kinde of habit, but they vary according to the time or the quality of the Perſon, and alſo in the forme and ſhape of it. The Matrons here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore did goe with naked armes, breſts, and ſhoulders, and now they cover all with thin Vailes according to the Spaniſh faſhion. The Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians goe civilly and neatly, the Florentians, the Tuſcians, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diolanians, the Aemilians, and Ligurians, doe goe ſomewhat braver. But the Romane Courtier doth excell all the reſt for long various colour'd Garments, but the Romane Citizen goeth more frugally, yet hanſomely, but eſpecially the women who of late did affect the Tuſcane dreſſing. <hi>Naples</hi> hath a habit that is more ſhining and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dide than coſtly. The Mediolanians in their apparell are gorgious, the Genoas neat, the Mantuans childiſh, the Neapolitans coſtly, the Venetians magnificent, the Florentines ridiculous.

The Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans are bountifull, the Ferrarians ſtiffe conceited, the Venetians crafty, the Cremonians plaine and open, the Picenians backbiters, the Romanes unjuſt.

And although it be not fortified with walls, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, or Towers, yet it is ſtrong by the naturall ſituation. It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with many Channels. There are Rivers in all the ſtreets, which are joyned together by 450. ſtone and woodden Bridges. The chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Channell is that which is called <hi>Canal grande,</hi> three miles long, which devideth the whole Citty into two parts. So that you may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goe on foote, or by Boate, of which there are 8000. thorow the Citty, they commonly call theſe Boates <hi>Gondelas.</hi> The compaſſe of this Citty is about 8. miles, which is famous for populouſneſſe, wealth, and ſtore of Merchandiſe: it hath produced excellent wits, and moſt learned men, and it is adorned with good Lawes, and laudable Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. It doth abound with Corne which is brought thither out of divers parts of the World, as alſo with divers ſorts of Wine, among which is that generous ſort of Wine, which is commonly called Malmeſy, and with other things, neceſſary to mans life, ſo that it may be rightly call'd the Paradiſe of Delight. There are in it 64. Pariſhes. There are alſo magnificent and ſumptuous publike and private buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. The chiefeſt Church is that which is dedicated to Saint <hi>Marke</hi> the Evangeliſt, which is gilded in many places. And to omit other matters, there is an Armory within the Citty, commonly call'd the <hi>Arſenale,</hi> which is about two miles in compaſſe. Here are made of Wood, Iron, Braſſe, Hempe, and Flaxe, all kindes of proviſion for Ships, as Anchors, Guns, Cables, Ropes, Tackles, and Sailes. Here are alſo ſome Enſignes kept which were taken from the Turke, or Pirates, or Enemies, and thoſe Trophies which were taken at <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pactum</hi> in the yeere 1581. And alſo there are the Praetorian Barges, and the Ship <hi>Bucentaurus,</hi> in which the Prince accompanied with the Senate and chiefe men of the Citty, is carryed every yeere to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Sea, where the Caſtle ſtandeth, and there after ſome Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies performed by the Biſhop, he marrieth the Sea, and puts a Ring upon it to ſhew his perpetuall dominion over it. There is alſo a publike Library, together with the Library of <hi>Beſſarion</hi> Cardinall of <hi>Nicen,</hi> which at his death he gave to the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice. Venice</hi> is very populous, ſo that there are thought to be in it about 300000. Citizens. They are of three ſorts or rankes: the Patricians who governe the Empire and Common-wealth: the Citizens who doe beare under Offices: and the Artificers who uſe Mechanick Arts. And beſides theſe there are great ſtore of Merchants and Strangers, which come thither in divers habits out of all parts of the World to

trafficke: as Turkes, Aethiopians, Slavonians, Arabians, Syrians, Cretenſians, Cyprians, Macedonians, Germanes, Hungarians, Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Frenchmen, and others. The Venetian Common-wealth was governed at the firſt by Conſuls, afterward by Tribunes for 252. yeeres: afterward in the yeere 707. it began to be a Dukedome. The Duke commonly call'd <hi>Doge,</hi> is the head of the Common-wealth, and the Prince of the Senate, and he can doe nothing neither in time of peace or warre without the conſent of the Senate, for he conſulteth with them. The Senate make Decrees which yet are publiſhed in the Dukes name. The Duke hath certaine ſtipends paid him out of the publike ſtock: and after his deceaſe another is choſen by ſuffrages and voyces, out of the Senate.

Miles: the bredth from the Caſtle on the Frontiers even to Rivoltella is forty Miles. The ſoyle in ſome parts is ſtony, and therefore untilled, and ſome part of it is very good.

I cannot omit this one thing that when the Venetians did fortifie this Citty, they found certaine hollow Caves, and when they digged in the Mountaines, they found Vrchins or hedghoggs of ſtone, alſo Oiſters, Birds bills, and ſtarre fiſhes which were as hard as any Stones.</p>

Moreover there is a Lake in this Country, which affordeth every yeare a harveſt, fiſhing, and hunting. The Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants doe call it <hi>Zircknitzerzee</hi> from the Towne <hi>Zircknitz,</hi> which is ſituated by it. But I will make a more accurrate deſcription of it out of <hi>George Wernherus:</hi> it is encloſed every where with Mountaines, for halfe a Mile together it is not very broade. Out of the Mountaines there doe iſſue certaine ſmall Rivers, which are every one contayned in their owne Channells: on the Eaſt ſide there are three, on the South five. The farther that they runne the more narrower they grow, for their bankes are ſtraite, untill they are ſwallowed up in the hoany paſſages of the Cliffes, which ſeeme as if they were cut out by humane Induſtry. So that where they find an open place the waters doe ſpread abroade, and make a Lake. Theſe waters doe as ſpeedily runne back as they flowe forward, not onely in thoſe narrow channells, but alſo through the earth, which when the Inhabitants perceive, they ſtopp the greater paſſages, and Concavities, and ſo goe to fiſhing, which is both pleaſant and profitable. For the fiſh which they take here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalted is tranſported to other Countries. Moreover when the Lake is drie they have a kind of harveſt, for they ſowe it and mowe it before that it be overflow'd againe. It beareth ſuch abundance of graſſe, that in twenty dayes it will be ready to cut. Who therefore cannot chuſe but admire at theſe wonders of nature? But ſo much cocerning theſe things, I paſſe to the reſt.</p>

                        <p>THis Contry is now called <hi>Terra Laboris,</hi> or <hi>Terra di Lavoro,</hi> that is the Land of labour.

In the fartheſt part of the Iland, there is a Fountaine of ſweet water, which is called <hi>Arethuſa,</hi> which is very great, and full of fiſh, which would be coverd with the waves of the Sea, but that it is walled about with ſtones. But there is another Citty of <hi>Syracuſa</hi> which is called <hi>Acardina,</hi> in which there is a great Market-place, a faire Gallery, and Counſell-houſe, a great Court, and a Temple of <hi>Iupiter Olympus,</hi> and many private Aedifices. There is a third Citty which is called <hi>Tyche,</hi> in which there is a great Schoole, and many Churches, and it is well inhabited and frequented. The fourth Citty is that which becauſe it was laſt built, is called <hi>Neapolis,</hi> or the new Citty, in which there is a great Theater, &amp; two great Churches, one conſecrate to <hi>Ceres,</hi> and another to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and a faire Statue of <hi>Apollo,</hi> which is called <hi>Tennites.</hi> But not all the beauty of this Citty is decayd, and onely ſome ruinous parts of the Towne are remaining. <hi>Meſſana</hi> is a Citty by the Sea ſide, the Inhabitants whereof were firſt called Meſſanians, and afterward Mamertinians, which <hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Thucydides</hi> doe mention. There is alſo <hi>Catina,</hi> which is called <hi>Catana,</hi> where <hi>Charonda</hi> the Lawmaker was borne, and it hath now a famous Schoole. <hi>Taurominium</hi> is a Citty built by the Zanclaeans, it is now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Taormina.</hi> There is alſo <hi>Leontium,</hi> where <hi>Gorgias Sophiſta</hi> was borne. <hi>Agrigentum</hi> is an ancient Citty, which heretofore the Carthaginians raced, and <hi>Megalus</hi> and <hi>Feriſcus</hi> re-edified it againe.

This Sangiack is called by the Barbarians <hi>Morabegi,</hi> whoſe yeere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revenewes in this Province 700000. Aſpers, that is, 14. thouſand Crownes.

Afterward <hi>Phidius</hi> the Athenian did ſett up a great Image of <hi>Iupiter</hi> of Gold and Ivory, being 60. foote high, which worke was reprehended by other Artificers, becauſe the Image was not proportionable to the Temple. For whereas this <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſate in an Ivory Throne, and yet touched the top of the Church with his head, it muſt needs come to paſſe that if this Ivory god being weary of ſitting would riſe up at any time, that hee muſt throw downe the top of the Church.

                        <hi>Corfu</hi> which <hi>Ptolemy</hi> calls <hi>Corcira</hi> is a faire Iland, being ſtrong both by Land and Sea. It is 2. miles diſtant from <hi>Epirus,</hi> where the Sea is ſtraiteſt, but where it is broadeſt 20. miles. It is 97. paces in length, as <hi>Pliny</hi> witneſſeth. The Climate is very temperate and gentle. ſo that there are whole woods of Citterne Trees, Orange Trees, and thoſe kindes of fruits. The ſoyle is fruitfull, having abundance of Vines, Olives, Apples, and other ſorts of fruits, here is alſo great ſtore of Honey. But it hath no good Corne in regard of the Southerne windes, which dryes it ſo much, that it withers before it come to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity and ripeneſſe. It is now ſubject to the Venetians, who defended it valiantly againſt the fury of the Turkes. It hath a Citty of the ſame name. The Inhabitants are Graecians.</p>

                        <hi>Zacynthus</hi> commonly called <hi>Zante. Pliny</hi> placeth it betweene <hi>Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leria</hi> and <hi>Achaja.</hi> It is 36. miles in compaſſe. This Iland bringeth forth great ſtore of Corne, but eſpecially Raiſons, Wine, and Oyle, out of which the Inhabitants doe yeerely make 150000. Crownes. They are Graecians and ſubject to the Venetians. It hath a Towne of the ſame name, with a Caſtle ſeated on a Mountaine, which hangeth over the Sea: it is full of Woods, and it is much commended for the

                        <hi>Naxus</hi> is an Iland which <hi>Sophianus</hi> and others call <hi>Niſsia.</hi> It is 80. miles in compaſſe. And it is reckoned among the fruitfull Iles. It hath great ſtore of Wine, and there is a kinde of Marble found in it, which the Graecians and <hi>Pliny</hi> doe call a Carbell, having ſpots like a Serpent. The ſtone alſo <hi>Smirillus</hi> wherewith Glaſiers cut their Glaſſe, which <hi>Pliny</hi> calls <hi>Smiris</hi> is found here.

Here is alſo a kinde of Waſpe, which if it ſting any one, he dyeth preſently afterward: alſo here are great ſtore of Bats. It was heretofore ſubject to <hi>Iohn Quirinus</hi> a noble Venetian. Afterward to Duke <hi>Iob Criſpus,</hi> whom <hi>Selinus</hi> the Turkiſh Emperour drove hence. But now it is inhabited by Turkes and Iewes.</p>

It is ſituate in the middle between <hi>Crete</hi> and <hi>Rhodes.</hi> The compaſſe of it is 60. miles, or as ſome will have it 70 miles. It is rugged and full of Mountaines, in which there are Mines of Marble. It had heretofore foure Citties, and therefore it was called <hi>Tetrapolis,</hi> as <hi>Euſtathius</hi> hath it upon <hi>Homer.</hi> It hath many Havens which are not very great, nor ſafe. The Inhabitants ſpeake Greeke, and doe embrace the Graecian Religion: but they are ſubject to the Venetians.</p>

The Metropolis is <hi>Teleuſina,</hi> which was heretofore a great Citty, but now it is for the moſt part ruinated. In the ſame Country there is alſo <hi>Algiers,</hi> a great Citty and well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
